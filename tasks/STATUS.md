# gjesus3 RDM Pilot — Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-07-11

This is the **lean current-state** view: where the system is *right now* and the few
things genuinely in flight. It deliberately stays short.

- **Later improvements** (refinements, second-/third-stage features) live in
  [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) — that is the home for "this makes it better later."
- **Full dated history** (every design decision and ingest round) lives in
  [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) and the authoritative specs in
  [`../mfb-rdm-docs/`](../mfb-rdm-docs/) (start at
  [`00_INDEX.md`](../mfb-rdm-docs/00_INDEX.md)).
- **Detailed historical work trails** (the old 749-line task list and the
  per-pass handoff/plan notes) are archived under [`archive/`](archive/).

## 1. Current state — TRUE PRODUCTION

gjesus3 has been in **true production since the 2026-06-10 restart**. The earlier
quasi-production pilot (per-instrument test → purge → accept, then a whole-system
purge after the team exhibition) is **complete and historical** — that purge already
happened on 2026-06-10. **There is no future exhibition / purge / restart pending.**
All data is real and retained long-term; treat the registry and `/raw/` with
production care.

**Scale (live `J:\gjesus3-data`):**

| | |
|---|---|
| Acquisitions in `/raw/` | **~13,555** (all checksummed + `metadata.json` sidecar'd) |
| Projects | **~50** (each with hard-linked raw data) |
| Subjects (`registry_subjects.csv`) | **~715** (one row per subject) |
| Publications | empty — deferred (PLANNED) |

**Instruments live (all in scope, operational):**

- **Microscopy** — AxioScan 7 (`ZWSI`), Cell Observer (`CELL`), LSM 900 confocal (`LSM9`)
- **MRI** — Bruker ParaVision (`MRI`)
- **Nuclear Imaging** — Molecubes / MILabs PET / SPECT / CT (`PET`, `SPECT`, `CT`)

All on-network historical imaging is ingested. Approximate per-instrument counts:
MRI ~10,314, Cell Observer ~1,739, LSM 900 ~805, AxioScan 7 ~565, Nuclear Imaging
~132. (Durable per-instrument record:
[`../equipment/historical_data_archives.md`](../equipment/historical_data_archives.md).)

**Tooling deployed:**

- **Operator GUI — `gjesus3_ingest.exe`** (one frozen Windows executable, ~95 MB,
  microscopy + MRI pages) is **live on the NAS** at
  `\\GJESUS3\gjesus3\gjesus3-data\tools\` (deployed 2026-06-24), with two UNC
  shortcuts and in-app HTML guides. The MRI page pulls **read-only** from the
  scanner over SFTP. See [`../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md`](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md) §5.2
  and [`../tools/OPERATOR_FAQ.md`](../tools/OPERATOR_FAQ.md).
- **Researcher Finder — `registries/index.html`** (self-contained searchable index
  of the registry, ~19 MB) is **live since 2026-06-23** — a global index plus a
  per-project `index.html` in each project folder, auto-refreshed at the end of
  every successful ingest. Researchers double-click it over SMB; no server. See
  [`../tools/FINDER.md`](../tools/FINDER.md).
- **Command-line ingest** (`tools/ingest_raw.py` + per-instrument configs) is the
  data-office path for bulk / historical ingest. See
  [`../tools/INGEST_CLI.md`](../tools/INGEST_CLI.md).

The system is **ready for operator hand-off across all instruments** and for batch
historical ingest. Nothing is mid-ingest; it is safe to restart at any time.

## 2. Active / Up next

The genuinely in-flight items (kept tight — everything else is in
[`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)):

- **Operator pilot test of `gjesus3_ingest.exe`.** Run the frozen exe on a clean
  (no-Python) machine, then a 1–2 friendly-operator pilot per page. The MRI page
  needs, per operator machine: the SFTP credential file `~/.ssh/gjesus3_mri.cred`
  (data office, out-of-band — the one prerequisite that blocks MRI on a fresh
  machine), reachability of the scanner host, and the NAS mount.
- **NI live-box sync — go-live.** The live-machine sync code is built and verified
  end-to-end in a sandbox (it is a config, not a new orchestrator — the existing
  `ingest_raw` does the walk). The remaining gate is **Gate-0**: confirm `os.link`
  (hard-link) behaviour on the live NI Mac's CIFS mount, then a vetted one-shot
  ingest per researcher. Archive-mode NI is already done and is the durable
  source-of-truth; live sync is the forward path for active project data.
- **No-DICOM MRI regeneration worklist.** Operator MRI ingests on Windows cannot
  run Dicomifier, so no-DICOM ParaVision exams queue to
  `registries/pending_dicom_regen.csv` for a later Linux re-pull + regenerate.
  Drain the worklist on a Dicomifier-capable (Linux/WSL) box as it accumulates.

### 2.1 Safe-operation follow-ups from the 2026-07-08 review (triaged 2026-07-11)

The [architecture + code review](archive/2026-07-08_architecture_code_review.md) was
triaged and its findings re-verified against the code (see
[`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md#architecture--code-review-follow-through-2026-07-08) for
the full per-item outcome). Three items are safe-operation and promoted here; all
other findings are confirmed-real *later improvements* and stay in `BACKLOG.md`.

- ⚠️ **Off-site backup / disaster recovery — the #1 risk.** One NAS, RAID 5 on
  20 TB drives, no off-array copy, in true production; for microscopy `.czi` this
  is the *only* copy. It is the single item that can cause total, unrecoverable
  loss. The 3-2-1 plan is already written
  ([`02_INFRASTRUCTURE §5.4`](../mfb-rdm-docs/02_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)); reframe from
  "PI decision" to a purchase and execute. Inaction, not a design gap.
- ⚠️ **Concurrency / partial-failure integrity fixes** (registry-vs-disk
  divergence). **Do first:** `tools/ingest/pending.py` rewrites the live 250-row
  recovery queue with a truncate-in-place `open(…,"w")` — a single interrupted
  ingest can zero it (fix = mirror `pending_dicom.py`'s temp+`os.replace`, under
  the lock). Then: dedup index is built pre-lock so a double-launched batch
  double-ingests (`config.py` vs the lock in `ingest_raw.py`); copy-phase verify
  failures early-return *before* the rollback `try`, orphaning half-copied folders;
  and move `committed=True` to immediately after `append_row` (1-line). #1/#3 are
  currently mitigated by the single-operator manual workflow — land them before any
  concurrent or automated ingest.
- 🕗 **Schedule `verify_checksums` weekly.** The tool exists but nothing runs it.
  With no DR yet, scheduled checksum verification is the only current tripwire for
  silent corruption — the cheapest partial mitigation for the durability gap.

**Not blocking** (tracked in [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)): external-drive microscopy
ingest; researcher-feedback re-projection of the best-guess legacy microscopy;
study-level project metadata (Phase 4 — planned, deployed on 0 of 50 projects
today); the various link-naming and `-None`-subject refinements; spectroscopy /
non-image MRI; the server-side ingest-host architecture.
