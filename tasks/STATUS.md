# gjesus3 RDM Pilot — Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-08-02

This is the **lean current-state** view: where the system is *right now* and the few
things genuinely in flight. It deliberately stays short.

- **Later improvements** (refinements, second-/third-stage features) live in
  [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) — that is the home for "this makes it better later."
- **Full dated history** (every design decision and ingest round) lives in
  [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) and the authoritative specs in
  [`../mfb-rdm-docs/`](../mfb-rdm-docs/) (start at
  [`00_INDEX.md`](../mfb-rdm-docs/00_INDEX.md)).
- **Detailed historical work trails** (the old 749-line task list and the
  per-pass handoff/plan notes) are archived under [`archive/`](archive/).

## 1. Current state — TRUE PRODUCTION

gjesus3 has been in **true production since the 2026-06-10 restart**. The earlier
quasi-production pilot (per-instrument test → purge → accept, then a whole-system
purge after the team exhibition) is **complete and historical** — that purge already
happened on 2026-06-10. **There is no future exhibition / purge / restart pending.**
All data is real and retained long-term; treat the registry and `/raw/` with
production care.

**Scale (live `J:\gjesus3-data`):**

| | |
|---|---|
| Acquisitions in `/raw/` | **13,557** (all checksummed + `metadata.json` sidecar'd) |
| Projects | **51 registered** — 43 with folders + **8 `closed`** (rows retained; 3 folders deleted 2026-07-14, 5 still present). **Folder name == project name** since 2026-08-02 (no `proj-` prefix) — see §2. |
| Subjects (`registry_subjects.csv`) | **~715** (one row per subject) |
| Publications | empty — deferred (PLANNED) |

**Two registry facts changed on 2026-07-14** (see [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)):

- **`researcher` is populated on 2,049 of 13,557 acquisitions** (backfilled from the
  project name where it named a person; lowercase first name). The other **11,508 are
  blank** — their project names name no person, so there is nothing to recover from.
  Anything better needs a new source, not another pass over the same data.
- **`registry_projects.csv` `start_date` / `last_activity` mean *acquisition* dates**,
  not ingest dates (they were previously a uniform 2026-06-1x ingest stamp). Projects
  are closed — folder deleted, row kept with `status=closed` — once the newest linked
  acquisition is **older than 3 years**. Project links are hard links, so a close-out
  never touches `/raw/`.

**Instruments live (all in scope, operational):**

- **Microscopy** — AxioScan 7 (`ZWSI`), Cell Observer (`CELL`), LSM 900 confocal (`LSM9`)
- **MRI** — Bruker ParaVision (`MRI`)
- **Nuclear Imaging** — Molecubes / MILabs PET / SPECT / CT (`PET`, `SPECT`, `CT`)

All on-network historical imaging is ingested. Approximate per-instrument counts:
MRI ~10,314, Cell Observer ~1,739, LSM 900 ~805, AxioScan 7 ~565, Nuclear Imaging
~132. (Durable per-instrument record:
[`../equipment/historical_data_archives.md`](../equipment/historical_data_archives.md).)

**Tooling deployed:**

- **Operator GUI — `gjesus3_ingest.exe`** (one frozen Windows executable, ~95 MB,
  microscopy + MRI pages) is **live on the NAS** at
  `\\GJESUS3\gjesus3\gjesus3-data\tools\` (deployed 2026-06-24), with two UNC
  shortcuts and in-app HTML guides. The MRI page pulls **read-only** from the
  scanner over SFTP. See [`../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md`](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md) §5.2
  and [`../tools/OPERATOR_FAQ.md`](../tools/OPERATOR_FAQ.md).
- **Researcher Finder — `registries/index.html`** (self-contained searchable index
  of the registry, ~19 MB) is **live since 2026-06-23** — a global index plus a
  per-project `index.html` in each project folder. Researchers double-click it over
  SMB; no server. **Refresh reworked 2026-07-20:** a scheduled global rebuild + a
  targeted per-project refresh when an ingest writes into a project (CLI opt-in via
  `--refresh-index`), replacing the old wholesale-rebuild-on-every-ingest. Both
  paths are live; the daily **global** rebuild now runs via the `WorkstationOps`
  `finder-refresh` op (03:00) — see §2.
  See [`../tools/FINDER.md`](../tools/FINDER.md).
- **Command-line ingest** (`tools/ingest_raw.py` + per-instrument configs) is the
  data-office path for bulk / historical ingest. See
  [`../tools/INGEST_CLI.md`](../tools/INGEST_CLI.md).

The system is **ready for operator hand-off across all instruments** and for batch
historical ingest. Nothing is mid-ingest; it is safe to restart at any time.

## 2. Active / Up next

The genuinely in-flight items (kept tight — everything else is in
[`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)):

- **Project reference model — ✅ LANDED + MIGRATED IN PRODUCTION, exe redeployed (2026-08-02).**
  The last two items from the 2026-07-17 operator test. **"Project hint" is retired**: a
  project now has just `project_id` (`PROJ-XXXX`, machine key) and a **`name`** — what the
  operator types, and **its folder name verbatim** (no `proj-` prefix, casing preserved).
  The GUI field is **"Project name"**, the config key is `registry.project_name`, and
  `registry_raw`'s column is now honestly called `project_id` (it always held ids).
  **Operators must know two things:** (1) the **6 saved recipes on the NAS were deleted**,
  not migrated — recreate them in the builder (a recipe carrying the old key would now
  error on load, which is worse); (2) **project folders were renamed** — `proj-ae-biomegune-0525`
  is now `AE-biomaGUNE-0525`, `proj-claudia` is now `claudia`. Any saved shortcut into a
  project folder needs re-pointing; `/raw/` was not touched and no data moved.
  Live migration done in a no-ingest window via `tools/migrate_project_naming.py`
  (dry-run-first, resumable, `--reverse`-able; kept as the paper trail): 51 registry rows,
  **48 folders renamed**, 43 `_project.yaml` rewritten, header-only change to `registry_raw`
  (values untouched — all 13,582 verified still joining). Hard links intact (134/134 pairs
  confirmed same-file), Finder regenerated, exe rebuilt + redeployed (checksum-verified,
  previous kept as `.old_20260802`) and smoke-tested against the migrated schema. Backup
  off-NAS at `C:\Users\rtasseff\temp\gjesus3_projectnaming_backup_20260802` — keep until
  the first operator ingest confirms good. Model + consumer table:
  [`../mfb-rdm-docs/05_PROJECTS.md`](../mfb-rdm-docs/05_PROJECTS.md) §2a; full record in
  [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md). **Still open (deliberately):** the *semantic*
  re-projecting of person/topic projects (PROJ-05 / [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)) — this was
  mechanical normalization only; and the 5 closed-but-present folders, whose deletion
  remains a separate Data-Office action.
- **Scheduled global Finder rebuild — ✅ MIGRATED to WorkstationOps + LIVE (2026-07-24).**
  The daily global rebuild is now owned by the separate **`WorkstationOps`** app
  (`C:\Users\rtasseff\OneDrive - CIC biomaGUNE\WorkstationOps`, its `finder-refresh` op,
  daily 03:00; that repo's commit `8759673`) — schedule, run log, health/overdue signal, and
  failure notification. This repo keeps only the generator (`tools/generate_index.py`).
  Cutover done: the interim `gjesus3 Finder refresh` 05:00 task was unregistered,
  `WorkstationOps-finder-refresh` scheduled at 03:00 (verified Ready, next run confirmed), and
  `tools/scheduled_finder_refresh.bat` deleted. Operational detail + the repo-move
  interdependency: [`../mfb-rdm-docs/11_OPERATIONS.md`](../mfb-rdm-docs/11_OPERATIONS.md) §5.6.
- **Operator-GUI polish — ✅ LANDED; merged to `main` (`97500cb`), exe rebuilt + REDEPLOYED + validated in production (2026-07-20).** Four GUI items
  from the 2026-07-17 microscopy operator test (issues 2/3/4 + the index-refresh addendum):
  (1) the metadata-token palette now offers the **full resolver token set**
  (`original_name`, `instrument`, …) in the builder + both runner palettes + the MRI
  page, sourced from one list in `resolver.py` (new `/api/link_tokens`) so it can't drift;
  (2) operator-visible **"NAS" → "RDM System"** across templates / JS / help / two `app.py`
  error strings, with a `GLOSSARY.md` definition (internal `nas_root*` identifiers untouched;
  one residual in the shared-core `env.NasRootError` message deliberately left — a
  Data-Office call);
  (3) a **completion modal** on real (non-dry-run) ingest, both pages, dismissible +
  accessible (new `static/completion_modal.js`);
  (4) **per-project Finder refresh on GUI ingest** — the GUI called the ingest functions
  directly and bypassed `ingest_raw.main`'s auto-refresh, so a GUI upload never updated
  any index; the ingest worker now regenerates just the touched project's `index.html`
  (targeted `--project`, never the global index — that's the scheduled job), on both pages,
  best-effort. Merged `main` (finder-refresh foundation) into the branch; spec bundles
  `generate_index.py` + `find_acq.py`.
  **Rebuilt + deployed:** `gjesus3_ingest.exe` rebuilt (off-OneDrive temp dir) and
  redeployed to `\\GJESUS3\…\tools\` backup-first (old exe + all registry CSVs backed up
  off-NAS; staged-copy + rename because a transient SMB lock blocked the in-place overwrite),
  checksum-verified byte-identical, temp build erased. **Validated in production** through the
  deployed exe by a real AxioScan ingest of one animal `.czi` into the existing PROJ-0014 —
  all four fixes confirmed live (tokens, no "NAS", completion modal, and the project
  `index.html` hash/mtime changed with the new acq present = the refresh fired in-frozen) —
  then **fully removed** backup-first, every count back to baseline. The removal surfaced the
  hidden `.acq_id_seq.json` ACQ-ID reservation (ids are never auto-reused), now documented.
  **Docs:** [`../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md`](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md) §2.1 gained a
  **Side-effect inventory** — every file/row an ingest writes + how to reverse each
  (cross-linked from `INGEST_CLI.md`).
  Branch + worktree retired; `refactor/project-naming` (P) now builds on `main`. Narrative in
  [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md); the temporary handoff + addendum notes were dropped on
  landing (per the 2026-07-17 precedent).
- **Operator-GUI fixes landed + VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION, exe redeployed (2026-07-17).**
  Both branches merged to `main`, the fixed `gjesus3_ingest.exe` rebuilt and
  **deployed to the NAS** (`\\gjesus3\…\tools\`; old exe + registries backed up
  off-NAS first), and validated end-to-end by a real 9-acquisition AxioScan ingest
  **through the deployed exe** — all 9 wrote `README.txt` (the former crash point) and
  auto-derived anatomy from the organ map, confirming both fixes work in-frozen. The
  smoke-test acqs were then removed (registry back to 13,557).
  - **Frozen-exe resource loads** (`fix/gui-frozen-exe-resources`): the exe had
    **never completed a real ingest** — README generation crashed because the
    `ingest/` layer wasn't `sys._MEIPASS`-aware and `README_raw.txt` (+ `project.yaml`,
    `tools/reference/`) was never bundled. Fixed via a frozen-aware
    `ingest/resources.py` resolver + bundling; two guarded siblings
    (`create_project.py`, `anatomy_derive.py` — silent microscopy-anatomy loss) closed too.
  - **Recipe override semantics** (`fix/microscopy-gui-filters-and-gaps`): a recipe
    could show one config in the GUI but ingest another. Independently reviewed
    ([`../tools/operator/gui/microscopy_gui_override_semantics_review.md`](../tools/operator/gui/microscopy_gui_override_semantics_review.md))
    and fixed — the builder writes structural keys explicitly (erasing the
    `group_code=MFB` filter now CLEARS it) and the runner shows/enforces the EFFECTIVE
    filter (narrow-only); blank-start builder kept; value-field catalogue unified.
  - **Remaining:** a quick live-GUI eyeball of the erase-filter WYSIWYG interaction
    (the ingest path is proven); the operator microscopy pilot can now run on the
    deployed exe. (The Finder `index.html` wasn't auto-refreshed by that GUI
    ingest — root-caused 2026-07-20: the GUI never called the CLI's refresh path.
    Fix in progress — a scheduled global rebuild + a targeted per-project refresh;
    the per-project GUI wiring ships with the next exe build. See
    [`../tools/FINDER.md`](../tools/FINDER.md).)
- **Operator pilot test of `gjesus3_ingest.exe`.** Run the frozen exe on a clean
  (no-Python) machine, then a 1–2 friendly-operator pilot per page. The MRI page
  needs, per operator machine: the SFTP credential file `~/.ssh/gjesus3_mri.cred`
  (data office, out-of-band — the one prerequisite that blocks MRI on a fresh
  machine), reachability of the scanner host, and the NAS mount.
- **NI live-box sync — go-live.** The live-machine sync code is built and verified
  end-to-end in a sandbox (it is a config, not a new orchestrator — the existing
  `ingest_raw` does the walk). The remaining gate is **Gate-0**: confirm `os.link`
  (hard-link) behaviour on the live NI Mac's CIFS mount, then a vetted one-shot
  ingest per researcher. Archive-mode NI is already done and is the durable
  source-of-truth; live sync is the forward path for active project data.
- ✅ **No-DICOM MRI regeneration — DRAINED 2026-07-16** (branch
  `feat/dicom-regen-backfill`; full narrative in [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)).
  The worklist (`registries/pending_dicom_regen.csv`, 612 rows) is at **0 `pending`**:
  **153 `regenerated`** (17,122 DICOMs / 1.64 GB filled into the existing
  `<ACQ-ID>.data/` placeholders — ACQ-IDs kept, registry rows updated in place via the
  new `registry.update_row`, the 78 blank `acquisition_datetime` all real now, ages
  refilled wherever a `date_of_birth` exists), **365 `not-applicable`**
  (spectroscopy/calibration — the input set for the deferred spectroscopy path,
  `BACKLOG.md`), and **94 `no-source`** (image exams with no reconstructable source on
  the platform host — 80 header-only + 14 fid-only; a data-loss record, not a task).
  The blocker was closed as designed: a standalone backfill on the recovery pattern
  ([`tools/backfill_dicom_regen.py`](../tools/backfill_dicom_regen.py); spec
  [`10_TOOLS §3.8`](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md), procedure
  [`11_OPERATIONS §5.5`](../mfb-rdm-docs/11_OPERATIONS.md)) — plus a **third Dicomifier
  workaround** ([`tools/ingest/dicomifier_driver.py`](../tools/ingest/dicomifier_driver.py)):
  stock Dicomifier crashes on all 153 (single 3D volumes stored reverse-slice-order)
  and its slice flip is a silent no-op; both fixed + pixel-level validated (upstream
  issue draft pending filing). Project hard-links rebuilt from Windows (663 created —
  incl. 510 pre-existing empty shells left by the 2026-06-14 relink; the 2 remaining
  candidates are the known link-name-collision pairs, `BACKLOG.md`). Invariant — **no
  DICOM-less acquisition without a worklist row** — holds
  ([`tools/backfill_pending_dicom.py --dry-run`](../tools/backfill_pending_dicom.py)
  → 0 to add). The operator runbook was corrected (false idempotency claim) and
  archived to `tasks/archive/`.
- ✅ **`age_at_acquisition` derived against the ingest date — FIXED 2026-07-15**
  (commit `f567fae`). 92 no-DICOM MRI acquisitions carried an age measured to their
  *ingest* date (`ACQ-20260613-MRI-001`: dob 2021-06-09 → `P1830D`, exactly its
  2026-06-13 registration date) — a plausible number in a DB-sourced field, not an
  obvious null. **Writer:** `ingest_raw.py` Step 3 falls back to `datetime.now()`
  for the ACQ-ID prefix and used to hand that placeholder to
  `enrichment.build_enrichment`; it now withholds it, so the age stays blank when
  there is no real date. Fixed at the call site deliberately — `_acq_for_age`'s
  ACQ-ID-prefix fallback is *correct* for the DICOM-StudyDate branch and only the
  caller can tell the two apart. Pinned by `test_age_needs_a_real_date`.
  **Data:** all 13,557 sidecars were rescanned (each age recomputed from its own dob
  against the registry date) — exactly 92 wrong, 0 disagreements among the 10,666
  with real dates; those 92 are now blanked on the NAS (age only; backup at
  `gjesus3_age_blank_backup_20260715`) and a rescan reports 0. **Closed 2026-07-16:**
  the backfill drain (item above) refilled ages from real regenerated-DICOM dates
  wherever a `date_of_birth` exists; rows without a dob stay blank (that gap is the
  `pending-db` subject-metadata lane, not this bug).

### 2.1 Safe-operation follow-ups from the 2026-07-08 review (triaged 2026-07-11)

The [architecture + code review](archive/2026-07-08_architecture_code_review.md) was
triaged and its findings re-verified against the code (see
[`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md#architecture--code-review-follow-through-2026-07-08) for
the full per-item outcome). Three items are safe-operation and promoted here; all
other findings are confirmed-real *later improvements* and stay in `BACKLOG.md`.

- ⚠️ **Off-site backup / disaster recovery — the #1 risk.** One NAS, RAID 5 on
  20 TB drives, no off-array copy, in true production; for microscopy `.czi` this
  is the *only* copy. It is the single item that can cause total, unrecoverable
  loss. The 3-2-1 plan is already written
  ([`02_INFRASTRUCTURE §5.4`](../mfb-rdm-docs/02_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)); reframe from
  "PI decision" to a purchase and execute. Inaction, not a design gap.
- ✅ **Concurrency / partial-failure integrity fixes — LANDED 2026-07-12** (merged to
  `main`, commit `911f69e`; unit-tested, no live-NAS operations). The `pending.py`
  recovery-queue write is now atomic (temp+`os.replace`) and serialized under the
  registry lock; copy-phase verify failures roll back their partial folder;
  `committed=True` moved inside the lock right after `append_row`; and
  `checksum_present` now reports "N" for the empty no-DICOM MRI placeholder instead
  of a hardcoded "Y". **Still open from this cluster:** the **pre-lock dedup
  snapshot** (`config.py` builds the dedup index before `ingest_raw.py` takes the
  lock, so a double-launched batch can double-ingest) — needs design input, tracked
  in [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md). Currently mitigated by the single-operator manual
  workflow; land it before any concurrent or automated ingest.
- 🕗 **Schedule `verify_checksums` weekly.** The tool exists but nothing runs it.
  With no DR yet, scheduled checksum verification is the only current tripwire for
  silent corruption — the cheapest partial mitigation for the durability gap.

**Not blocking** (tracked in [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)): external-drive microscopy
ingest; researcher-feedback re-projection of the best-guess legacy microscopy;
study-level project metadata (Phase 4 — planned, deployed on 0 of 50 projects
today); the various link-naming and `-None`-subject refinements; spectroscopy /
non-image MRI; the server-side ingest-host architecture.
