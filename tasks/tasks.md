# MFB gjesus3 RDM Pilot — Task List

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-22

This file consolidates all open and completed tasks. Completed items are kept for context but marked with ~~strikethrough~~.

---

## 0. Active Pass / Up Next

> **⚠️ All current ingests are quasi-production.** Each instrument is iterated test → purge → accept-as-quasi-production. After the team exhibition, **everything gets purged** and true production restarts incorporating exhibition feedback. "Done" below means done in the quasi-production sense; the TEST tagging in config filenames + registry notes is intentional and stays.
>
> **⚠️ System role reframed 2026-05-20.** gjesus3 = research-facing working layer (5-year active window), complementing — not replacing — the platforms' deep-archive of raw bytes. Folder-as-primary is now permitted for ecosystems whose data lands as many files (internal MRI). See [`13_GJESUS3_ROLE`](../mfb-rdm-docs/13_GJESUS3_ROLE.md).

**Rounds completed in quasi-production state:**

| Round | Instrument | Outcome on NAS | Config(s) |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| 1–2 | Collaborator DICOM (XMRI) | 75 acqs across PROJ-0001 (LIONS, 42) + PROJ-0002 (HPIC, 33) | `lions_*.yaml`, `hpic_*.yaml` |
| 4 | AxioScan 7 (ZWSI) | 28 acqs across PROJ-0003/0004/0005 (`ae-biomegune-{0423,0424,0525}`) | `axioscan7_20260506.yaml` (+ TEST) |
| 5 | Cell Observer (CELL) | **165 acqs across PROJ-0006/0007/0008** (`itziar-colageno`, `itziar-alphasma`, `itziar-colageno-permeabilizado`) — exercised **both filename-focused and path-focused metadata extraction** on real Ainhize/Itziar data | `cell_observer_itziar_alphasma_TEST.yaml`, `cell_observer_itziar_colageno_perm_TEST.yaml` |

Round-5 round-up (Cell Observer) detail trail in §4.6.B.

### Round 6 — **Internal MRI (Bruker ParaVision)** — ACTIVE

Creds for the MRI server obtained 2026-05-20; sample data manually pulled to `D:\projects\gjesus3\data_test\` (one ParaVision study with ~10–16 numbered exams). Implementation plan locked in [the round-6 plan file](../../../.claude/plans/i-have-the-creds-reactive-candle.md).

**Decisions locked for this round:**
- ACQ unit = examination (assay). One numbered ParaVision exam = one ACQ-ID. ISA terminology adopted: investigation=project, study=session, assay=acquisition.
- **No zipping.** Folder-as-primary in `/raw/` for internal MRI. Acquisition folder = the unit (with `reconstructions/pdata_<idx>/` + `acquisition_aux/` substructure). New registry column `primary_kind: folder` (DRAFT).
- **ParaVision JCAMP-DX aux files (`subject`/`acqp`/`method`/`visu_pars`) are canonical metadata source**, not DICOM headers. New `tools/ingest/paravision_metadata.py` mirroring `czi_metadata.py` shape. New `tools/ingest/jcampdx.py` parser.
- **Reconstruction selection = per-batch YAML flag** (`reconstructions: all | [3] | 3`); no implicit default.
- **`regex_extract:` option in `filename_parse`** — extracts named groups from messy FTP folder names.
- **NIfTI generation is a project-level tool**, deferred — NOT a `/raw/` ingest step. Lives in `/projects/<proj>/derived_nifti/`, removed at project close-out.

§4.5 has the full execution checklist. Stream A (docs, ✅ committed `17ac781`) and Stream B (extractor + parser + probe, ✅ committed `66887ae`) shipped. Stream C (pipeline + template + config + FTP) ran end-to-end with 97/97 success but surfaced two bugs (sidecar key `dicom`→`mri` + `.lnk` filename collisions). **Stream D** (in progress 2026-05-22): adds the `link_filename:` YAML field framework, exhaustive per-instrument template comments listing `discovered.*` references, systematic-naming-convention docs for MRI + the NI future round, and the user-as-operator / NI-tgz / MRI-naming-ambiguity future tasks. After Stream D the 97 first-ingest acqs get purged and re-ingested with the corrected `.lnk` naming.

**Other waits (not blocking round 6):**

| Pass | Section | Blocked on |
|------|---------|-----------|
| LSM 900 confocal (`LSM9`) | §4.6.C | Ainhize Urkola Arsuaga to provide a detailed example. Expected source `K:\gjesus\Ainhize\CONFOCAL LSM 900\`. |
| Nuclear Imaging (`PET`/`SPECT`/`CT`) | §4.7 | Platform Manager **Unai** to answer one outstanding question before we submit the data-workflow documentation + example. |

**If switching between passes**, each per-pass section has a "Pickup context" subsection written to be read cold.

## 2. Data Types and Metadata

> **Note:** Most items in 2.1–2.2 will be resolved through the per-modality ingestion testing in Section 4. Each modality test pass examines real files, audits embedded metadata, exercises extraction code, and produces a working example dataset.

### 2.1 Data Types Inventory
- [x] ~~Data types sign-up sheet created~~ — done (09_MODALITIES Section 3)
- [ ] Complete data type sign-up sheet — need volunteer owners per type (MOD-02)
- [ ] Conduct show-and-tell walkthrough for each confirmed data type (MOD-03)
- [ ] Collect one representative example dataset per type for script testing — resolved per-modality in Section 4

### 2.2 Instrument Metadata Audit
> Resolved per-modality during ingestion testing (Section 4). Each test pass audits embedded metadata for that format.
- [ ] DICOM (collaborator) — resolved during Section 4.2
- [ ] .czi from Axio Scan 7 (WSI) — resolved during Section 4.6
- [ ] .czi from Cell Observer — resolved during Section 4.6
- [ ] .czi from LSM 900 — resolved during Section 4.6
- [ ] Confirm Cell Observer and LSM 900 .czi metadata is similar to WSI .czi (MOD-07)
- [ ] DICOM from MRI platform — resolved during Section 4.7

- [ ] Determine ISA-TAB-Nano applicability for nanomaterial imaging (META-04, if SEM/TEM included)

### 2.4 Modality Decisions
- [ ] SEM/TEM inclusion decision (MOD-01) — awaiting PI confirmation
- [ ] MRI: do the two systems (7T, 11.7T) need separate instrument codes? (09_MODALITIES)
- [ ] NIfTI: confirm whether Nuclear Imaging platform provides NIfTI, and if so, accepted format on gjesus3

---

## 3. Scripts and Tooling

> **Note:** Script implementation and finalization happens iteratively through the per-modality ingestion tests (Section 4). Each modality may expose new requirements for extraction, compression, and registry population.

### 3.1 Ingest Pipeline
- [x] ~~`ingest_raw.py` implemented~~ — single-case, batch, interactive, dry-run modes
- [x] ~~Format-summarizer dispatch (DICOM + microscopy)~~ — `FORMAT_SUMMARIZERS` map in `config.py`; replaces hard-coded DICOM in Step 1
- [x] ~~Microscopy single-file ingest path~~ — non-DICOM `primary_file_name = {acq_id}{ext}`, single-file copy + verify
- [x] ~~Filename parser~~ — `tools/ingest/filename_parser.py` (positional, named fields)
- [x] ~~`metadata.json` sidecar writer~~ — `tools/ingest/metadata_sidecar.py`; cross-format shape matching the on-disk DICOM example (`user_supplied` + `discovered` + `<ecosystem_section>`)
- [x] ~~Auto-discover generalization~~ — `expand_batch` accepts file globs, `filename_parse`, `filter`, `acquisition_date_from: parent_folder_name`; everything lands in the per-case `discovered` namespace
- [x] ~~Idempotent re-runs~~ — `expand_batch` skips files already in registry by `(acquisition_date, original_name)`
- [x] ~~`--delete-source` flag~~ — cross-instrument; default OFF; never touches the parent of `source_path`
- [x] ~~`probe_czi.py` utility~~ — read-only embedded-metadata probe (informs follow-up extraction)
- [x] ~~Three-block YAML schema (`ingest:` / `auto_discover:` / `registry:`) replaces `defaults:` and `SPECIAL_FIELDS`~~ — explicit per-column registry mapping with literal | `discovered.X` | `${...}` interp | NA. Resolver in `tools/ingest/resolver.py`; template at `tools/templates/ingest_template.yaml`; configs land in `tools/configs/`.
- [x] ~~`ingest_config` registry column~~ — relative path of the YAML config that produced each row, for auditability/reproducibility.
- [x] ~~`.czi`-internal metadata → `discovered.czi_*` + `metadata.json.microscopy`~~ — done 2026-05-06; `tools/ingest/czi_metadata.py` surfaces 21 curated fields (precise acquisition timestamp, microscope, objective, pixel size, dimensions, channels, etc.) and a structured 5-bucket `microscopy:` sidecar block. Library: `czifile`. Per-instrument table in [09_MODALITIES §1.1](../mfb-rdm-docs/09_MODALITIES.md), library rationale in [10_TOOLS §2.1.2](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md).
- [x] ~~Defensive header validation in `registry.append_row`~~ — refuses to write if existing CSV header doesn't match `REGISTRY_FIELDS`; prevents silent column-shift corruption like the one caught when `ingest_config` was added.
- [ ] **REMBI projection** — defer until batch ingestion across multiple instruments gives us real data to map *from*; then design per-instrument projections in a separate utility (lossless sidecar stays canonical). See [08_METADATA §3.5](../mfb-rdm-docs/08_METADATA.md).
- [ ] DICOM full-mode metadata extraction → `discovered.dicom_*` + `metadata.json.dicom` (deferred — separate stream); compression to `.zip`/`.tar.gz` — tested in Section 4.2. Will mirror the `.czi` pattern.
- [ ] **XMRI/DICOM `acquisition_datetime` auto-extract from DICOM headers → `discovered.dicom_*`.** Currently a manual literal in the `registry:` block. Becomes automatic once the DICOM extractor ships.
- [ ] **OMERO export / pylibCZIrw / Bio-Formats** — currently unneeded; revisit when there's a concrete use case (image server, OME-XML normalization, pixel access). See [10_TOOLS §2.1.2](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md).
- [x] ~~**`path_parse` YAML feature** (design intent locked 2026-05-13; implemented 2026-05-14 in `tools/ingest/config.py:expand_batch`).~~ Symmetric to `filename_parse`: name the path levels between `staging_dir` and the file via `auto_discover.path_parse.levels: [...]`; each becomes `discovered.<name>`. Recursive glob auto-enabled. Mismatched-depth files skip with WARN. Filename chunks override path levels on name collision. Documented in [10_TOOLS §2.1.3](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md). Cell Observer use exercised via synthetic-fixture smoke test; first real-data exercise pending in §4.6.B.
- [x] ~~**`auto_create_project:` YAML block** (DECIDED + implemented 2026-05-14).~~ Optional top-level block, peer to `auto_discover:` / `registry:`. Supplies `owner` / `description` / `notes` for first-time project auto-creation; resolver-evaluated. First-write-wins (subsequent ingests with the same project_hint log INFO and skip the block). Empty resolved values WARN and continue. Documented in [10_TOOLS §2.1.4](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md); cross-refs in [05_PROJECTS §7+§10](../mfb-rdm-docs/05_PROJECTS.md), [06_REGISTRIES §4.2](../mfb-rdm-docs/06_REGISTRIES.md). Universal template + AxioScan template updated. Cell Observer template still to be created (round-5 §4.6.B).
- [x] ~~**Cross-check WARN for path_parse / filename_parse collisions** (surfaced during round-5 Cell Observer 2026-05-15; implemented 2026-05-15).~~ When path_parse and filename_parse both produce values for the same `discovered.<key>` and the values disagree, a per-key WARN fires naming the file + both values + the documented "filename wins" behaviour. Same-value collisions are silent (redundant but harmless). Implemented in `tools/ingest/config.py:expand_batch`. Documented in [10_TOOLS §2.1.3](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md). Smoke-test verified with mismatched / matched / orthogonal cases. Related deferred cleanup: support `_` placeholder chunks in `filename_parse.fields` / `path_parse.levels` to express "this position is informational, don't store it" — would let configs avoid intentional collisions altogether. Optional strict mode (fail on mismatch) also deferred — WARN-and-continue is the right default during the pilot.
- [ ] Implement `--lightweight` flag in `ingest_raw.py` — tested in Section 4.2
- [ ] Add NIfTI handling (single file, no archive) — tested in Section 4.8 if applicable
- [ ] Implement `backfill_metadata` utility for upgrading lightweight ingests
- [ ] Finalize scripts after all modality passes (Section 4.9)
- [ ] **Sample-ID convention follow-ups** (round-4 raised, no urgency):
  - [ ] PI sign-off on the DRAFT composite `sample_id = <short_project>_<short_sample>` (REG-01 still open; see [06_REGISTRIES §2.3](../mfb-rdm-docs/06_REGISTRIES.md))
  - [ ] Confirm with team whether the trailing organ letter (`H`, `B`, ...) inside short sample IDs is a real convention worth parsing — feeds into the `anatomical_entity` future column below.
  - [ ] (Optional / future) Predefined chunk-name set that auto-promotes to specific registry columns — explicit `registry:` mapping is the model today; this would be a layer on top, not a replacement.
- [ ] **Sample-type vocabulary follow-ups** (REG-07; see [06_REGISTRIES §2.4](../mfb-rdm-docs/06_REGISTRIES.md)):
  - [ ] PI sign-off on the DRAFT 5-value vocab (`tissue` / `organism` / `cells` / `material` / `phantom`).
  - [ ] Apply across remaining instruments as they come online — set the appropriate default in each per-instrument template under `tools/templates/instruments/`.
  - [ ] (Future) Add dedicated `sample_organism` (e.g. `Mus musculus`) and `anatomical_entity` (e.g. `heart`, `brain`) columns to the raw registry — splits the current freeform `"mouse lung section"`-style strings into queryable fields. Coordinate with REG-01 (composite sample_id) and the organ-letter parsing question so we don't duplicate effort.
- [ ] **Refactor [11_OPERATIONS §3.2 Quick Start](../mfb-rdm-docs/11_OPERATIONS.md) for multi-instrument** — current text is AxioScan-7-specific (share path example, config-name example, filename pattern). Once 2-3 instruments are live, separate the common workflow steps from the per-instrument specifics (per-instrument Quick Start subsections or table of "for your instrument, share = ... / filename pattern = ... / starter config = ...").

#### Round 6 (Internal MRI / Bruker ParaVision) — in progress 2026-05-20

- [ ] **`tools/ingest/jcampdx.py`** — minimal pure-Python JCAMP-DX text parser (~80 LOC). Handles `##KEY=value` scalars, `##KEY=( N )` arrays spanning multiple lines, `<...>` strings, `$$` comments. No third-party dependency. Used by `paravision_metadata.py`.
- [ ] **`tools/ingest/paravision_metadata.py`** — Bruker ParaVision metadata extractor mirroring `czi_metadata.py` shape. `load_paravision_exam()`, `build_mri_section()` (4 curated buckets + `_raw_metadata`), `EXPOSED_FIELDS` (~15 `discovered.mri_*`), `extract(exam_path) -> (discovered_subset, mri_section)`. ParaVision aux files (`subject`/`acqp`/`method`/`visu_pars`) are canonical metadata source for internal MRI — not DICOM headers. Documented in [10_TOOLS §2.1.2b](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md), [08_METADATA §4.3](../mfb-rdm-docs/08_METADATA.md), [09_MODALITIES](../mfb-rdm-docs/09_MODALITIES.md) MRI section.
- [ ] **`tools/ingest/probe_paravision.py`** — read-only probe utility mirroring `probe_czi.py`. Dumps parsed JCAMP-DX + curated subset to `_probes/` for review.
- [ ] **Detector dispatch under `FORMAT_EMBEDDED_EXTRACTORS["DICOM"]`** in `tools/ingest/config.py` — if `acqp` + `method` are present alongside the source, call `paravision_metadata.extract`; else return `({}, {})` (collaborator XMRI behaviour preserved).
- [ ] **`regex_extract:` option in `filename_parse`** — optional `regex:` block in `auto_discover.filename_parse` extracts named groups from arbitrary names. Needed for messy FTP folder names like `20251016_083822_jrc_251016_m17_0424_jrc_251016_m17_0424_1_1` → `discovered.jrc_id`. Reusable beyond MRI. Documented in [10_TOOLS §2.1.3](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md).
- [ ] **`acquisition_layout: file | archive | folder` flag** in `ingest:` block (default `file`). MRI uses `folder` (no zip, folder-as-primary). Drives the file-copy step and the new `primary_kind` registry column. Documented in [10_TOOLS](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md) `ingest:` flags table and [03_RAW_STORAGE §4.2](../mfb-rdm-docs/03_RAW_STORAGE.md).
- [ ] **`reconstructions:` flag** (MRI-specific) — `all` \| integer \| list of integers. Selects which ParaVision `pdata/<idx>/` reconstructions to retain. No implicit default; user explicitly decides per-batch. Discarded indices stay only on the platform's deep-archive.
- [ ] **`tools/ftp_mirror.py`** — standalone SFTP CLI using `paramiko`. Inputs: host, user, password (env var / local file outside repo), remote study path, local staging dir. Recursively mirrors a study folder to local staging; idempotent. Decoupled from `ingest_raw.py` — fetch first, then ingest the staged copy. On-acquisition-machine script remains out of scope (Phase 4 of [`mri_data_access_strategy.md`](../equipment/mri-platform/mri_data_access_strategy.md)).
- [ ] **`link_filename:` YAML field** (added 2026-05-22 in response to round-6 first-ingest `.lnk` collision bug). New top-level field, resolver-evaluated at link-creation time. Context = `discovered.*` + resolved registry fields + `acq_id` + `acq_date`. Per-instrument templates ship recommended defaults: microscopy / external = `${instrument}_${original_name}`; internal MRI = `MRI_${sample_id}_${acq_date}_${discovered.mri_exam_number}_${discovered.mri_recon_indices}`. Falls back to `original_name` when unset (backward-compatible with rounds 1-2 / 4 / 5). Implementation: `resolver.resolve_link_filename()` + config pass-through + `ingest_raw.py` Step 12 wiring. Documented in [10_TOOLS §2.1.5](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md).
- [ ] **Sidecar section-name override** (round-6 first-ingest fix). Embedded-metadata extractors may return a 3-tuple `(discovered, section_dict, section_name_override)` to control the sidecar block key. ParaVision dispatcher uses this to put data under `metadata.json.mri` (not `dicom`) since the contents are ParaVision-specific, not generic DICOM headers. Backward-compatible with 2-tuple returns. Implementation in `tools/ingest/config.py::_extract_dicom_embedded` + downstream consumers.

#### Future work (documented for later, not in scope this round)

- [ ] **Our own raw→DICOM regeneration at ingest** (assessment task). Currently Bruker's converter produces the per-frame `.dcm` files; the user has flagged that we may want to generate DICOM ourselves so we know exactly what's in them. Tasks: characterize what Bruker's converter does, identify what we'd want to differ, evaluate cost of replacing it. Decision deferred.
- [ ] **Enhanced MR / Multi-Frame DICOM evaluation.** The classic per-frame `.dcm` layout is why an MR acquisition lands as N files. The modern DICOM standard (Enhanced MR / Multi-Frame DICOM) puts all frames in one file — if we adopt it, we get back to one-primary-file-per-ACQ even for DICOM. Evaluate in connection with the previous future-task.
- [ ] **DICOM full-mode metadata extraction for collaborator XMRI** (existing §3.1 deferred item, independent of round-6 work). Will mirror the `.czi` pattern: curated `discovered.dicom_*` + structured `dicom:` sidecar block + full pydicom dump. Library: `pydicom`. Doesn't block any in-flight round; can be prototyped against the 75 existing XMRI acquisitions whenever.
- [ ] **User-as-operator permissions model for internal MRI / internal NI** (added 2026-05-22). Unlike microscopy, internal MRI and NI have no dedicated operator — researchers run the equipment themselves. Today the data office runs ingest under a shared platform-account identity. Future model needs an ingest-time write path to `/raw/` that respects the "raw is read-only after deposit" rule without requiring a dedicated technician account. Coordinate with the raw-immutability lockdown design (§4.3) and the project close-out tool's controlled-write path (§3.2). Open question to the platform managers: do they have user-accounts that could be used? Or should ingest always run under a service identity? Captured but not designed.
- [ ] **Internal Nuclear Imaging (NI) ingest round** — likely round 7 or 8, depending on when Unai answers the naming-convention question (§4.7). Conventions documented in [`equipment/nuclear-imaging/internal_ni_data_handling_workflow_notes.md`](../equipment/nuclear-imaging/internal_ni_data_handling_workflow_notes.md); per-instrument template will be cloned from `mri_bruker.yaml` and adapted. Pre-requisite work that's not blocked on Unai: design the tgz-aware staging step (below).
- [ ] **NI tgz nested-archive parsing** (future-round prep). NI data lands as `.tgz` archives on `\\cicmgsp02\gnuclear2$`; inside is a `.tar` containing the recon-level dir structure. Two options: (a) extract tgz → local staging area before `expand_batch` runs (simpler, matches the `ftp_mirror.py → ingest` pattern); (b) extend the ingest with a tgz-aware glob. Option (a) recommended. Will need a small `tgz_extract.py` utility or just a shell-out step before ingest. Documented in the NI workflow notes.
- [ ] **MRI naming-convention stakeholder follow-up** (added 2026-05-22). The platform's project-folder naming has a documented ambiguity: `<group PI initials><YYYYMMDD>` is sometimes written `jrc251016` (intended convention) and sometimes `jrc_251016` (with underscore). The round-6 `regex:` extractor handles both, but a long-term fix is to ask the platform manager to standardise. Captured in [`equipment/mri-platform/internal_mri_data_handling_workflow_notes.md`](../equipment/mri-platform/internal_mri_data_handling_workflow_notes.md) "Systematic naming convention" section.

### 3.2 Other Scripts
- [x] ~~`create_project.py` implemented~~ — CLI + interactive, dry-run
- [ ] `create_publication` — requirements defined, not yet implemented
- [ ] `log_activity` (provenance helper) — requirements defined, not yet implemented
- [ ] `validate_registries` — planned (REG-04)
- [ ] `verify_checksums` — planned
- [ ] **Study-metadata work stream** (architecture in [08_METADATA §1](../mfb-rdm-docs/08_METADATA.md), 2026-05-12). Order is roughly: gather → import → close-out. None blocks the first user-driven Phase B ingest.
  - [ ] **`gather_metadata.py`** (read-only utility) — given an acq_id (or project), join `/raw/<ACQ-ID>/metadata.json` with the corresponding `/projects/<proj>/metadata/<acq_id>.json` (and `study.json` / `biosamples.json`) on `acq_id` and emit a merged view (JSON or pretty-printed). The "single source of truth" for consumers (OMERO, future DB, analysis scripts) until indexing is built. Small (~40 lines); ship early.
  - [ ] **Excel → study-metadata importer** (researcher-facing). Reads a per-project `study.xlsx` with a defined sheet layout (study sheet + biosamples sheet + optional per-acquisition supplements sheet), validates against a schema, writes `/projects/<proj>/metadata/{study,biosamples,<acq_id>}.json`. Schema needs design; the Excel layout will live alongside the tool. This is what unblocks Users (researchers) to actually contribute REMBI study/biosample context.
  - [ ] **Project close-out tool** (Data Mgmt Lead procedure). Given a project ready for closure: (1) read `/projects/<proj>/metadata/`; (2) for each acq_id referenced, merge the study-level metadata into `/raw/<ACQ-ID>/metadata.json` under a `study:` block (additive, never overwriting acquisition-level fields); (3) if the project promoted to a publication, also stage a copy under `/publications/<pub-id>/`; (4) verify writes; (5) only then delete the project folder. Requires admin write access to `/raw/`. Has implications for the raw-immutability lockdown (§4.3) — that lockdown design must allow the Lead to perform these merges. Document the procedure (manual recipe first, scripted tool after).
  - [ ] Document the merge format in [08_METADATA](../mfb-rdm-docs/08_METADATA.md) — `metadata.json.study` block shape — once the Excel-importer schema settles.
  - [ ] **Project-level NIfTI generation tool** (NEW 2026-05-20, MRI-driven but generalizable). Reads chosen ACQ-IDs via the project's `raw_linked/` shortcuts, runs `dcm2niix` (or `bruker2nifti`) per acquisition, writes `<ACQ-ID>.nii.gz` under `/projects/<proj>/derived_nifti/`. Removed at project close-out — regenerable from raw if needed later. Aligns with the [13_GJESUS3_ROLE](../mfb-rdm-docs/13_GJESUS3_ROLE.md) reframe (research-facing derivatives belong in projects, not in `/raw/`). Library choice (dcm2niix subprocess vs bruker2nifti Python) TBD when implementation starts. Cross-referenced in [08_METADATA §1.5a](../mfb-rdm-docs/08_METADATA.md).

### 3.3 Infrastructure Decisions
- [ ] Where scripts will run — designated workstation vs user machines (TOOL-01)
- [ ] Git repo location and access for scripts (TOOL-02)
- [ ] Script distribution approach — git repo, shared folder, or pip package
- [ ] User training on CLI tools (TOOL-03)
- [ ] GUI wrapper priority — gather user feedback (TOOL-04)

## 4. Per-Modality Ingestion Testing

> **Approach:** Each modality gets its own test pass. This is how we work through the metadata audit (Section 2.2), example datasets (2.1), format confirmations (2.4), and script refinement (3.1). Each pass follows the same pattern: get sample data → inspect files → test extraction → test ingest → verify outputs. Script improvements carry forward to subsequent passes.
>
> **Prerequisite for all passes:** Ryan manually copies data to local drive before extraction/ingestion. Primary ingest path uses fast local storage per the off-NAS staging decision.

### 4.1 Prepare Local Staging (one-time)
- [x] ~~Backup originals to `staging/_originals_backup/` on NAS~~
- [x] ~~**Ryan:** Copy `staging/HPIC_33cases/` and `staging/LIONS_42cases/` from NAS to local drive~~
- [x] ~~Extract all archives on local drive (unrar/unzip)~~

### 4.2 Pass 1: Collaborator DICOM (HPIC/LIONS — `XMRI`)
> First modality. Exercises DICOM header reading, archive compression, full vs lightweight modes.
- [x] ~~Inspect extracted DICOM contents (verify structure, count files, check headers with pydicom)~~
- [x] ~~Audit embedded metadata — what DICOM fields are present and useful? (feeds 2.2)~~
- [x] ~~Test full-mode ingest: dry-run on one HPIC case, verify outputs~~
- [x] ~~Test maximal metadata extraction (all available DICOM header fields → metadata.json)~~
- [ ] Test lightweight mode (sparse registry entry, `extended_metadata_present` = `N`) — full-mode covered, lightweight path still untested
- [x] ~~Test real ingest on one HPIC case, verify: acquisition folder, archive, metadata.json, checksums.json, registry row~~

### 4.3 Linking Method and Raw Immutability
> **Critical constraint:** Raw acquisition folders must be read-only after deposit (DECIDED — see 03_RAW_STORAGE Section 7). The linking method must work *without* requiring write access to raw folders.

**Linking method — decision and unit test (resolved):**
- [x] ~~Decide linking method~~ — **Windows `.lnk` shell shortcuts** (Windows-first, pilot-specific; see 10_TOOLS §2.1.1)
- [x] ~~Validate `.lnk` behavior over SMB empirically~~ — 75 manually-created links across HPIC and LIONS work fine
- [x] ~~Update `linker.py` to actually create `.lnk` files~~ — done 2026-05-05; PowerShell `WScript.Shell` shell-out, idempotent, Windows-only for creation
- [x] ~~Wire linker into `ingest_raw.py`~~ — Step 12; runs when `project_hint` is set and `--nas-unc` is provided
- [x] ~~Linker unit sanity test~~ — `create_lnk()` standalone produces a working `.lnk` (correct icon, double-click opens, target UNC correct)

**Linking — end-to-end testing (still open; the new code path has never been exercised through a real ingest):**
- [ ] Dry-run an ingest config with `project_hint: PROJ-0001` — verify Step 12 logs the would-be `.lnk` path without creating anything
- [ ] Real single-case ingest with `--project PROJ-0001` on a fresh acquisition — verify the new `.lnk` appears in `projects/proj-lions-cardiac-mri/raw_linked/` and behaves like the existing 75
- [ ] Idempotency check — re-run the same ingest, confirm no error and the existing `.lnk` is left untouched
- [ ] Failure-mode sanity: bogus `--project PROJ-9999` → warns + skips, ingest still succeeds
- [ ] Failure-mode sanity: `--nas-unc ""` → disables `.lnk` creation, ingest still succeeds
- [ ] (Optional) Backfill check — re-run the original LIONS/HPIC batch configs with the new linker code to confirm idempotency on the existing 75

**Raw immutability (still open):**
- [ ] Apply post-deposit lockdown on one test acquisition folder (chmod or ACL — determine which works on QNAP SMB)
- [ ] Verify raw folder is truly read-only from Windows SMB and WSL
- [ ] Verify links are **read-only traversal** — users can follow the link and read files but not modify raw data through the link
- [ ] Decide: script the post-deposit lockdown into `ingest_raw.py`, or keep it as a separate admin step?
- [ ] **The lockdown must preserve a Data-Mgmt-Lead write path** — the project close-out tool (§3.2) needs to merge study-level metadata into `/raw/<ACQ-ID>/metadata.json` post-lockdown. Either: (a) Lead has an admin account whose group ACL allows write on `/raw/` even when general users see it as read-only; or (b) Lead temporarily un-locks → writes → re-locks. Pick when implementing the lockdown.
- [ ] (Deferred to future deployments) Symlink-based linking via WSL or SSH-into-NAS — see porting note in 10_TOOLS §2.1.1

### 4.4 Batch Ingest: Collaborator DICOM
- [x] ~~End-to-end dry-run of batch config for HPIC (all 33 cases)~~
- [x] ~~Batch ingest all 33 HPIC cases~~ — registry confirmed (PROJ-0002)
- [x] ~~Post-ingestion verification: registry completeness, checksum spot-check, Windows SMB access~~
- [x] ~~End-to-end dry-run of batch config for LIONS (all 42 cases)~~
- [x] ~~Batch ingest all 42 LIONS cases~~ — registry confirmed (PROJ-0001)
- [x] ~~Post-ingestion verification~~

**Cleanup follow-ups discovered post-ingest (2026-05-05 audit):**
- [ ] Dedupe `registries/ingest_manifest.csv` — `LEONE_1.01.zip` appears 2×, `HPIC02.rar` appears 3× (raw registry itself is clean — single row per ACQ)
- [ ] Backfill `acquisition_datetime` for `ACQ-20260310-XMRI-001` (HPIC11) — date couldn't be parsed at ingest, fell back to registration date
- [ ] (Optional) Re-run ingest on existing 75 acquisitions with new linker code — idempotent (skips existing `.lnk` files); confirms all 75 project links are accounted for and creates any that are missing

### 4.5 Pass 2: Platform DICOM — Internal MRI (`MRI`) — ROUND 6 ACTIVE 2026-05-20

> **Pickup context (read first if returning to this section cold):**
> - **This is round 6 of the pilot, in progress.** Internal MRI = Bruker ParaVision platform (two systems: 7T and 11.7T, three ParaVision versions coexist v3.6/v6/v7). NOT to be confused with collaborator XMRI (rounds 1-2, already deposited as zips).
> - **Access:** SFTP credentials obtained 2026-05-20. Sample data manually pulled to `D:\projects\gjesus3\data_test\` (one ParaVision study with ~10–16 numbered exams). Full access-strategy still in [`equipment/mri-platform/mri_data_access_strategy.md`](../equipment/mri-platform/mri_data_access_strategy.md) — Option A (FTP-from-workstation) is what we're executing.
> - **Round 6 reframe** ([13_GJESUS3_ROLE](../mfb-rdm-docs/13_GJESUS3_ROLE.md), 2026-05-20): gjesus3 is the research-facing working layer; the platform's own archive handles deep preservation. This justifies the no-zip / folder-as-primary layout for internal MRI.
> - **Acquisition unit:** examination (assay). One numbered ParaVision exam = one ACQ-ID. ISA terminology: investigation=project, study=session (`session_id` column DRAFT), assay=acquisition.
> - **Metadata source:** ParaVision JCAMP-DX aux files (`subject`/`acqp`/`method`/`visu_pars`/per-recon `visu_pars`+`reco`) are **canonical**, not DICOM headers. New `paravision_metadata.py` + `jcampdx.py` modules mirror the `.czi` extractor shape. Collaborator XMRI DICOM-header extraction stays deferred as an independent stream.
> - **Layout:** `/raw/DICOM/<year>/<year-month>/ACQ-<date>-MRI-<exam>/` with `metadata.json` + `checksums.json` at the root, `reconstructions/pdata_<idx>/` subfolders (per `reconstructions:` YAML flag), `acquisition_aux/` for exam-level aux files. No zip. `primary_kind: folder` in the registry.
> - **Two MRI systems** (Bruker BioSpec 11.7T and 7T) — open question whether they need separate instrument codes or share `MRI`. Default: share, until evidence pushes otherwise.
> - **NIfTI conversion is OUT OF SCOPE** for this round at `/raw/` ingest. Project-level NIfTI generation tool tracked in §3.2 as future work. The platform's own NIfTI from `tools.all2nifti.sh` may or may not be in the source data; we don't depend on it.
> - **Plan file:** [the round-6 plan](../../../.claude/plans/i-have-the-creds-reactive-candle.md) has the full design + sizing.

**Prerequisites:**
- [x] ~~SFTP credentials obtained~~ — 2026-05-20.
- [x] ~~Sample data pulled to `D:\projects\gjesus3\data_test\`~~ — one ParaVision study with ~10–16 numbered exams.
- [ ] Confirm DICOM and/or NIfTI is on the source (sample shows: ParaVision `2dseq` + Bruker-exported `.dcm` per reconstruction; NIfTI not present in this sample). NIfTI generation deferred to project-level tool per [13_GJESUS3_ROLE §5.3](../mfb-rdm-docs/13_GJESUS3_ROLE.md).

**Stream A — Documentation (in progress 2026-05-20):**
- [ ] [13_GJESUS3_ROLE.md](../mfb-rdm-docs/13_GJESUS3_ROLE.md) — NEW (the reframe doc).
- [ ] [01_OVERVIEW.md](../mfb-rdm-docs/01_OVERVIEW.md) §2 + §5.3 reframe.
- [ ] [03_RAW_STORAGE.md](../mfb-rdm-docs/03_RAW_STORAGE.md) — per-ecosystem layouts + MRI folder exception in §4.
- [ ] [06_REGISTRIES.md](../mfb-rdm-docs/06_REGISTRIES.md) §2.3a ISA terminology + DRAFT `session_id` + `primary_kind` columns.
- [ ] [08_METADATA.md](../mfb-rdm-docs/08_METADATA.md) §4.3 `mri:` block + project-level tool family additions.
- [ ] [10_TOOLS.md](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md) §2.1.2b ParaVision extractor + §2.1.3 `regex_extract:` + `ingest:` flags table updates.
- [ ] [tasks.md §0 + §3.1 + §3.2](.) — round-6 active state + future-work entries.

**Stream B — Extractor + JCAMP-DX parser + probe:**
- [ ] `tools/ingest/jcampdx.py` (NEW) — JCAMP-DX text parser (~80 LOC).
- [ ] `tools/ingest/paravision_metadata.py` (NEW) — extractor mirroring `czi_metadata.py` (~250 LOC). EXPOSED_FIELDS lists the curated `discovered.mri_*` fields.
- [ ] `tools/ingest/filename_parser.py` — add optional `regex:` extraction (~30 LOC).
- [ ] `tools/ingest/config.py` — wire ParaVision dispatcher under `FORMAT_EMBEDDED_EXTRACTORS["DICOM"]` (content-based detect).
- [ ] `tools/ingest/probe_paravision.py` (NEW) — probe utility (~40 LOC).
- [ ] **Probe verification** — run on one exam from `D:\projects\gjesus3\data_test\<study>\29\`. Confirm ~15 `discovered.mri_*` fields populate. Iterate EXPOSED_FIELDS if needed.

**Stream C — Ingest pipeline + per-instrument template + per-batch config + FTP retrieval:**
- [ ] `tools/ingest/config.py` — add `acquisition_layout: file | archive | folder` flag (default `file`); add `reconstructions:` plumbing.
- [ ] `tools/ingest_raw.py` — honour `reconstructions:` and no-zip folder layout for MRI: copy chosen recon indices into `reconstructions/pdata_<idx>/`, exam aux into `acquisition_aux/`.
- [ ] `tools/templates/instruments/mri_bruker.yaml` (NEW) — per-instrument template. `pattern: "*/*"` (study folders → exam folders). `regex_extract:` for the messy folder name. `reconstructions:` flag. `auto_create_project:` targeting the 4-digit project code.
- [ ] `tools/configs/mri_bruker_<test-batch>_TEST.yaml` (NEW) — first per-batch config against `D:\projects\gjesus3\data_test\`. Quasi-production TEST tagging per the established pattern.
- [ ] **Dry-run + real ingest** against the sample. Verify NAS state: acquisition folder, sidecar `mri:` block, registry row with exam-level granularity + `primary_kind: folder` + populated `discovered.mri_*` + `session_id`, project auto-create off the JRC project code, `.lnk` shortcuts, provenance row, **direct viewability without unzipping**.
- [ ] **Idempotency check** — re-run, verify zero duplicate rows.
- [ ] `tools/ftp_mirror.py` (NEW) — SFTP CLI via `paramiko`. Mirrors a remote study folder to local staging. Decoupled from ingest.

**Documentation (during / after the pass):**
- [ ] [09_MODALITIES.md](../mfb-rdm-docs/09_MODALITIES.md) MRI section — per-instrument `discovered.mri_*` fields table mirroring the AxioScan §1.1 pattern.
- [x] ~~[08_METADATA.md](../mfb-rdm-docs/08_METADATA.md) §4.3 — `mri:` sidecar block shape (committed in Stream A 17ac781).~~
- [x] ~~[10_TOOLS.md](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md) §2.1.2b — ParaVision extractor; §2.1.3 — `regex_extract:`; §2.1.5 — `link_filename:` (committed in Stream A 17ac781 + Stream D).~~
- [x] ~~[equipment/mri-platform/internal_mri_data_handling_workflow_notes.md](../equipment/mri-platform/internal_mri_data_handling_workflow_notes.md) — new "Systematic naming convention" section (2026-05-22).~~
- [x] ~~[equipment/nuclear-imaging/internal_ni_data_handling_workflow_notes.md](../equipment/nuclear-imaging/internal_ni_data_handling_workflow_notes.md) — NEW doc capturing NI convention for the future round (2026-05-22).~~
- [ ] `00_INDEX.md` — version history (round-6 final entry once Stream D commits).

**Stream D — round-6 follow-up (2026-05-22, in progress):**
The first round-6 ingest (97/97 success against `D:\projects\gjesus3\data_test\`) surfaced two bugs that the round-6 plan was extended to fix:
1. **Sidecar key `dicom:` should be `mri:` for ParaVision data.** Fixed: extractor dispatcher returns a 3-tuple `(discovered, section, "mri")` to override the ecosystem-derived section name. See `tools/ingest/config.py::_extract_dicom_embedded`.
2. **`.lnk` filename collisions** — 35 of 97 shortcuts silently lost because exam numbers (e.g. `27.lnk`) clash when multiple animal sessions land in the same project. Fixed via new top-level `link_filename:` YAML field; per-instrument templates ship recommended defaults. MRI default: `MRI_${sample_id}_${acq_date}_${discovered.mri_exam_number}_${discovered.mri_recon_indices}`. See [10_TOOLS §2.1.5](../mfb-rdm-docs/10_TOOLS.md).

**Outstanding:**
- [ ] **Purge** the first-ingest 97 acqs (registry restore from `.bak.20260521-171748`, delete acq folders, trim manifest, clean `.lnk` shortcuts + provenance rows). User-authorized.
- [ ] **Re-ingest** with the new `link_filename` pattern. Verify: 97 unique `.lnk` names, `metadata.json.mri` block populated, cross-modality demo (proj-0424 has both AxioScan + MRI shortcuts).
- [ ] **Commit Stream C + Stream D** as one atomic round-6 changeset, push to origin.

### 4.6 Pass 3: Microscopy .czi (`ZWSI`, `CELL`, `LSM9`)
> Completely different format — single-file primary, no archive needed, different metadata extraction library (czifile / aicspylibczi).

**4.6.A Axio Scan 7 (`ZWSI`) — first .czi pass:**
- [x] ~~Filename-driven auto-discover (group/operator/sample_id/...) wired into `expand_batch`~~ (see §3.1)
- [x] ~~Microscopy single-file copy + verify + canonical rename `{acq_id}.czi`~~ (see §3.1)
- [x] ~~`metadata.json` sidecar with `user_supplied` + `discovered`~~ (see §3.1)
- [x] ~~Read-only probe of one real .czi from `S:\...\AxioScan\20260422` (czifile + XML dump to `_probes/`)~~
- [x] ~~Real ingest of 3 `.czi` files from `S:\...\AxioScan\20260422` to NAS (first pass: filename-only metadata)~~ — first ingest 2026-05-06, then purged.
- [x] ~~Re-ingest of the same 3 files with .czi-internal metadata extraction~~ — 2026-05-06; populated `microscopy:` sidecar blocks (geometry, instrument, acquisition, mosaic, document_info, plus full `_raw_metadata` for lossless preservation; sidecar ~850 KB matching the probe) and 21-field `discovered.czi_*` curated subset. Registry CSV migrated to 22-column schema (added `ingest_config`); defensive header check added in `registry.append_row`.
- [x] ~~Project auto-create via `ingest.auto_create_projects: true`~~ — 2026-05-06; on first ingest with an unknown `project_hint`, ingest_raw creates the project (short_name = hint) and sets the registry's `project_hint` to the canonical `PROJ-XXXX`; subsequent acqs reuse via `short_name` lookup. Tested: PROJ-0003 (short_name=1022, owner=AUA) auto-created, 3 .lnk shortcuts placed in `/projects/proj-1022/raw_linked/`.
- [x] ~~Round-4 scale + multi-project + composite sample_id test (2026-05-12)~~ — `S:\...\AxioScan\20260506\` (28 MFB `.czi` files across 3 animal projects), single config `axioscan7_20260506_TEST.yaml`, end-to-end successful (28/28). Validated: composite `sample_id` via `${discovered.project}_${discovered.sample_short}`; full-code `project_hint = "AE-biomeGUNE-${discovered.project}"` → 3 projects auto-created with short_names `ae-biomegune-{0423,0424,0525}` and reused on subsequent files; 28 `.lnk` shortcuts (8/8/12 split); idempotent re-run (0 new rows, 28 dedupe skips + 1 filter skip); sidecar `discovered` block contains all 6 filename chunks + 21 `czi_*` fields, `microscopy._raw_metadata` ~366 KB. Purged after verification.
- [x] ~~User-facing manual-ingest documentation~~ (2026-05-12) — researcher Quick Start in [`11_OPERATIONS.md §3.2`](../mfb-rdm-docs/11_OPERATIONS.md); CLI reference (flags, config cheat-sheet, free-form chunk note) at [`tools/INGEST_CLI.md`](../tools/INGEST_CLI.md). Production config `axioscan7_20260506.yaml` shipped for user-driven Phase B re-ingest.
- [ ] **User (Phase B):** manually run `tools/configs/axioscan7_20260506.yaml` following the new Quick Start in `11_OPERATIONS.md §3.2`. Dry-run first, then real. Outputs become production data (PROJ-0003..0005 will be re-created with the same `ae-biomegune-*` short_names). Capture any doc-gap moments so the docs can absorb them.
- [ ] **User:** physically verify a `.lnk` shortcut opens the correct `.czi` on double-click for the new microscopy single-file shortcuts (covers the long-standing "open from .lnk" check originally tracked for the 2026-04-22 batch).

**4.6.B Cell Observer (`CELL`) — Round 5 (DONE 2026-05-15, quasi-production):**

> **Round-5 outcome (the short version):** 165 `.czi` acquisitions across 3 auto-created projects on the NAS, exercising **both ways of providing discoverable metadata** that the new YAML features enable. This is the canonical exhibit for showing the team how the same pipeline machinery handles different conventions by changing only the YAML — no code change.
>
> | Project | Acqs | Config | Approach exhibited |
> |---------|------|--------|--------------------|
> | PROJ-0006 `itziar-colageno` | 30 | `cell_observer_itziar_alphasma_TEST.yaml` | Filename-focused, side-effect (the `Itziar/**/*.czi` pattern caught the `colageno` experiment alongside `alphasma`) |
> | PROJ-0007 `itziar-alphasma` | 61 | `cell_observer_itziar_alphasma_TEST.yaml` | **Filename-focused** — 5-chunk filename carries `cell_line / experiment / magnification / condition / image_num`; path adds the same `cell_line` + `experiment` levels redundantly (collision-WARN exercised — see §3.1 done-item 2026-05-15) |
> | PROJ-0008 `itziar-colageno-permeabilizado` | 74 | `cell_observer_itziar_colageno_perm_TEST.yaml` | **Path-focused** — only 2-chunk filename (`condition_image_num`); the path levels (`researcher / cell_line / experiment`) supply the rest |
>
> Both TEST configs and the TEST notes in `registry_raw.csv` remain as-is by design — the whole quasi-production batch will be purged after the exhibition (see §0 banner). The exhibition-ready exhibit IS the contrast between the two configs.

**Pickup context (if returning cold):**
> - Cell Observer is a **separate physical instrument** from AxioScan 7 — different hardware (inverted epifluorescence vs. WSI scanner). Same vendor (Zeiss) and **same `.czi` format**, so `tools/ingest/czi_metadata.py` reused 1:1 — confirmed on the round-5 probe.
> - Operator workflow differs from AxioScan: data lives on the **instrument-local PC**, operator manually saves retained files to their own group-drive folder (variable per-operator path, no day-folder convention). See `equipment/cell-observer/cell_observer_data_handling_workflow_notes.md` for the full operator walkthrough.
> - Two effective modes of Cell Observer use: (a) **cell-assay / live-cell / plate-based** (sparse filenames, hierarchical folders by researcher / cell-line / experiment) — what round 5 shipped; (b) **animal/histology** (more AxioScan-like naming) — deferred (see below).
> - **Operators:** Both Ainhize Urkola Arsuaga and Marta operate the Cell Observer (and AxioScan); they're interchangeable for our purposes. Round 5 sample data came from Ainhize.
> - **The confocal (LSM 900) follows the same Cell Observer playbook**, so most of round-5's work transfers — see §4.6.C.

**Round-5 execution checklist:**
- [x] ~~Implement `path_parse` YAML feature~~ — done 2026-05-14, see §3.1.
- [x] ~~Implement `auto_create_project:` YAML block~~ — done 2026-05-14, see §3.1.
- [x] ~~Read-only probe with `tools/ingest/probe_czi.py` on Ainhize's sample `.czi`~~ — done; 21 curated `discovered.czi_*` fields populated as expected; `mosaic.tile_count` absent on non-tiled cells acquisitions (handled gracefully). MOD-07 confirmed.
- [x] ~~Create `tools/templates/instruments/cell_observer_cells.yaml`~~ — done. `path_parse: [researcher, cell_line, experiment]`, `filename_parse: [cell_line, experiment, magnification, condition, image_num]`, `sample_type: cells`, composite `sample_id: ${discovered.cell_line}_${discovered.condition}`, provisional `project_hint: ${discovered.researcher}-${discovered.experiment}` with the PROJ-05 warning prominent in comments. `auto_create_project` block with `owner: ${discovered.researcher}`.
- [x] ~~Author per-batch configs~~ — TWO configs landed (filename-focused + path-focused variants — see outcome table above).
- [x] ~~Real test ingest~~ — done 2026-05-14 and 2026-05-15. 165 acqs across 3 auto-created projects, all on the NAS in `J:\raw\MICROSCOPY\2025\` and `J:\projects\proj-itziar-*\`. Idempotency check passed; `.lnk` shortcuts created per project.
- [x] ~~Surface and fix collision behavior~~ — round-5 exposed that the same `discovered.<key>` can be populated by both `path_parse` and `filename_parse`; documented filename-wins behaviour and added the per-key WARN on mismatch. Tracked in §3.1.
- [ ] **User-driven Phase B re-ingest** (researcher self-runs the configs to validate the Quick Start docs) — deferred until after the team exhibition since the whole batch will be purged anyway. The exhibition itself is the Phase B substitute for round 5.
- [ ] **Physical `.lnk` double-click verification** (carried over from round 4) — user clicks a Cell Observer shortcut from `proj-itziar-alphasma\raw_linked\` and confirms it opens the canonical `.czi`. One-time UX confirmation.

**Documentation status:**
- [ ] `mfb-rdm-docs/09_MODALITIES.md` §1.2 (Cell Observer) — per-instrument `discovered.czi_*` fields table (mirror the AxioScan §1.1 table; note deviations from AxioScan such as absent mosaic.tile_count). Pending.
- [ ] `mfb-rdm-docs/11_OPERATIONS.md §3.2` Quick Start — refactor AxioScan-specific examples now that a second validated instrument exists. Pending.
- [ ] `mfb-rdm-docs/00_INDEX.md` — round-5 entry added 2026-05-18 (see version history).

**Deferred from this pass (queued for later):**
- [ ] **Animal/histology-mode Cell Observer template** — needs a real example folder of historical histology work (likely from a different researcher's older folder). The pipeline machinery is the same; only the YAML differs. Each historical batch / researcher convention probably needs its own per-batch config. Plan: one `cell_observer_histology.yaml` template once we have a representative example.
- [ ] **Historical Cell Observer histology backfill** — separate stream from going-forward cells-mode work. Operators used Cell Observer heavily for histology before AxioScan arrived; that data still needs ingest. Different researchers, different conventions per researcher / era. Use the same machinery, one per-batch YAML per historical batch.
- [ ] LSM 900 (§4.6.C) — should reuse most of the Cell Observer cells-mode template once validated; same instrument family, same data-handling model per the operator.

**4.6.C LSM 900 confocal (`LSM9`) — reuses 4.6.B Cell Observer template:**

> **Pickup context (read first if returning cold):**
> - LSM 900 is a Zeiss confocal microscope. Same vendor + same `.czi` format as Cell Observer and AxioScan, so `tools/ingest/czi_metadata.py` should reuse 1:1.
> - Per the operator walkthrough, LSM 900 follows the **same data-handling playbook as Cell Observer** — operator saves files manually to a group-drive folder, no day-folder convention, folder structure carries metadata. Expected source path: `K:\gjesus\Ainhize\CONFOCAL LSM 900\`.
> - Plan: reuse `cell_observer_cells.yaml` as the starting template; clone to `tools/templates/instruments/lsm900.yaml`, swap `instrument: LSM9`, adjust `path_parse` / `filename_parse` field names if Ainhize's confocal folder convention differs. Likely small delta.
> - **Blocked on:** Ainhize Urkola Arsuaga to provide a detailed example folder + filename convention. Once one real `.czi` arrives, this pass should be small (mirror round-5 §4.6.B closely).

**Prerequisites (need before starting):**
- [ ] **Ainhize:** Provide one detailed `.czi` example from the LSM 900, ideally with the typical folder layout intact. Expected location once provided: `K:\gjesus\Ainhize\CONFOCAL LSM 900\<researcher>\...`.
- [ ] **Ryan:** Copy locally for probing once Ainhize confirms the path.

**Execution (mirrors §4.6.B Cell Observer):**
- [ ] Read-only probe with `tools/ingest/probe_czi.py` — confirm similarity to Cell Observer / AxioScan (MOD-07 follow-up).
- [ ] Create `tools/templates/instruments/lsm900.yaml` (clone of `cell_observer_cells.yaml`, adjusted).
- [ ] Author the first per-batch config + dry-run + real test ingest (quasi-production).

**4.6.D Lightweight mode for microscopy:**
- [ ] Test `--lightweight` mode on one `.czi` file (sets `extended_metadata_present=N`, no sidecar)

### 4.7 Pass 4: Platform DICOM — Nuclear Imaging (`PET`, `SPECT`, `CT`)

> **Pickup context (read first if returning cold):**
> - Multimodal platform — PET, SPECT, CT, OI from Molecubes (γ/β/X-CUBES) + MILabs VECTor; may include hybrid PET/CT or PET/SPECT/CT sessions. Tests the multi-modality handling (a hybrid session should stay as one acquisition with `modalities_in_study` populated). Platform description: `equipment/nuclear-imaging/nuclearImaging_platform_description.md`.
> - **Naming convention + archive structure already documented** (2026-05-22) in [`equipment/nuclear-imaging/internal_ni_data_handling_workflow_notes.md`](../equipment/nuclear-imaging/internal_ni_data_handling_workflow_notes.md). Covers the archive path on `\\cicmgsp02\gnuclear2$`, the `<archive name>.tgz → .tar → user/series/.../recon_<n>/` nested structure, the funded-project-id vs animal-protocol-id distinction, and the proposed `link_filename` pattern. **No NI data is ingested yet.**
> - Both DICOM and NIfTI exports are produced (per the platform description). Confirm output format(s) with the platform manager when we engage them.
> - **Blocked on:** Platform Manager **Unai** to answer one outstanding question (around the data naming convention) before we submit our data-workflow documentation + example to him. Until that round-trip closes, we can't formalize the ingest workflow proposal, and we don't have sample data to probe yet.
> - **Code-side prerequisite shared with §4.5 MRI:** the DICOM full-mode metadata extractor + compress-on-ingest (§3.1) is the same code path. Prototype it against the existing 75 collaborator XMRI acquisitions while waiting on Unai — it'll be ready when sample data lands.
> - **NI tgz-aware staging** (§3.1 future work): NI archives unpack tgz → tar → nested tree; the ingest pipeline should extract to local staging before `expand_batch` runs (matches the `ftp_mirror.py → ingest` pattern). Design captured in the workflow notes.

**Prerequisites (need before starting):**
- [ ] **Ryan:** Resolve the open question with Unai (Platform Manager) on the naming convention; submit data-workflow documentation + example for his review once resolved.
- [ ] **Ryan:** Obtain sample Nuclear Imaging datasets (ideally one single-modality and one hybrid).
- [ ] Confirm output format(s) from the platform — DICOM, NIfTI, or both per acquisition? (MOD-05, Section 2.4).

**Execution (once unblocked):**
- [ ] Inspect file structure and headers — compare with MRI and collaborator DICOM.
- [ ] Audit embedded metadata (feeds 2.2).
- [ ] Test full-mode ingest on one case.
- [ ] Test hybrid handling — does a PET/CT session stay as one acquisition? Verify `modalities_in_study` field.

### 4.8 Pass 5: NIfTI (if applicable)
> Only if Nuclear Imaging platform provides NIfTI. Single file, no archive, limited header metadata.
- [ ] Confirm NIfTI is a real output from the platform (Section 2.4)
- [ ] If yes: inspect NIfTI header metadata — what's available?
- [ ] Implement NIfTI handling in ingest (single file, no compression) (feeds 3.1)
- [ ] Test ingest on one NIfTI file
- [ ] If no: mark this pass as N/A

### 4.9 Pass 6: EM (if included)
> Only if SEM/TEM is confirmed for pilot (MOD-01).
- [ ] Awaiting PI decision on SEM/TEM inclusion
- [ ] If included: obtain sample EM files, inspect formats and metadata
- [ ] Test ingest workflow for EM data

### 4.10 Finalize Scripts (WSL)
> After all modality passes are complete, finalize and harden the scripts.
- [ ] Finalize `ingest_raw.py` — full mode covering all tested modalities
- [ ] Finalize `ingest_raw.py` — lightweight mode (`--lightweight`)
- [ ] Finalize `linker.py` based on linking method decision (Section 4.3)
- [ ] Implement `backfill_metadata` utility
- [ ] Update documentation (10_TOOLS, 03_RAW_STORAGE) with any changes discovered during testing

## 5. Publication Back-Test

> **Approach:** After ingestion testing is working (Section 4), take a real completed publication from Susana or Irene and use it as a test case to validate the publication workflow end-to-end. These publications were assembled ad hoc — the raw data exists somewhere but there is no formal provenance trail or structured link back to raw acquisitions. Working backward from the finished product will reveal what provenance recording looks like in practice, how intermediate files should be tracked, and what the `raw_linked/` and `provenance.csv` setup should look like for a real publication folder.

### 5.1 Select and Set Up Test Case
- [ ] **Ryan:** Identify one completed publication from Susana or Irene that has data suitable for open access
- [ ] Inventory the publication folder contents — what files exist? (figures, analysis outputs, raw-adjacent files, scripts, etc.)
- [ ] Identify which raw acquisitions the publication depends on — are they already ingested? Can they be matched?

### 5.2 Trace Provenance Backward
- [ ] For each key output file (figures, processed images), trace back: what raw data did it come from? What intermediate steps were taken?
- [ ] Document the provenance chain — even if incomplete, capture what can be reconstructed
- [ ] Identify gaps: what information is lost because it wasn't recorded at the time?

### 5.3 Build the Publication Package
- [ ] Create a formal publication folder using `create_publication` (or manual equivalent)
- [ ] Populate `raw_linked/` — link back to the raw acquisitions (test the linking method decided in Section 4.3)
- [ ] Populate `provenance.csv` — record the traced provenance chain using the format from 07_PROVENANCE
- [ ] Identify intermediate/derived files — where do they live? How should they be referenced?

### 5.4 Evaluate and Refine
- [ ] Does the provenance format (07_PROVENANCE) work for this real case? What's awkward or missing?
- [ ] Does the publication folder structure (04_PUBLICATIONS) work? What needs adjusting?
- [ ] What would users need to do differently *during* a project to make this easy at publication time?
- [ ] Update documentation (04_PUBLICATIONS, 07_PROVENANCE) based on lessons learned
- [ ] Use findings to inform `create_publication` script requirements and `log_activity` design

## 6. Operations (after Sections 4–5)

- [ ] Define intake roles: who can promote staging to raw (OPS-01)
- [ ] Configure NAS user/group permissions (OPS-02)
- [ ] Write Quick Start guide for pilot users (OPS-03)
- [ ] Schedule pilot start date (OPS-04)
- [ ] Set pilot review cadence (weekly for 4-6 weeks) — defined in 11_OPERATIONS, not yet scheduled

---

## 7. Infrastructure

- [ ] Backup strategy — RAID 5 only, no offsite; define minimal mitigation
- [ ] Snapshot retention policy and restore procedure — snapshots confirmed active, details TBD
- [ ] Filesystem type confirmation — affects linking method and permission enforcement (resolved during Section 4.3)
- [ ] Raw immutability enforcement mechanism — chmod vs QNAP SMB ACLs; script vs manual (resolved during Section 4.3)

---

## 8. Deferred

- [ ] Curated datasets area — circle back after RAW ingestion is working (12_CURATED_DATASETS, EVALUATING)
- [ ] Raw data linking method for publications/projects — resolved during Section 4.3 testing
- [ ] Filename parser for legacy uploads — deprioritized
- [ ] User-supplied metadata workflows (CSVs/Excel for sample context) — deferred to post-pilot
- [ ] GUI wrappers for tools — deferred to post-pilot based on user feedback
- [ ] Operator encoding in ACQ-ID — registry only for now (RAW-01)
