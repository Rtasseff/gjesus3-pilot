# 04 — Publications Area

**Parent:** [Documentation Index](00_INDEX.md)  
**Status:** 🔶 Draft  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-02

---

## Purpose

This document specifies the structure, conventions, and workflows for the Publications storage area — the archive for publication-related data packages.

---

## 1. Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Long-term preservation** | Publication folders become static after publication |
| **Self-contained packages** | Each publication folder contains (or links to) everything needed to reproduce figures |
| **Provenance required** | Every non-boilerplate file has documented origin |
| **Flexible until closed** | Internal structure can evolve during preparation; rigidity only at closure |

---

## 2. Directory Structure

```

### 2.1 Required Contents

| Item | Required | Created When |
|------|----------|--------------|
| `_publication.yaml` | ✅ Yes | At folder creation |
| `provenance.csv` | ✅ Yes | At folder creation (empty template) |
| `raw_linked/` | ✅ Yes | At folder creation; populated during work |
| Final figures | ✅ Before closure | During preparation |
| Provenance entries for figures | ✅ Before closure | During preparation |

### 2.2 Optional but Recommended

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `figures/` | Organized location for publication-ready outputs |
| `analysis/` | Intermediate analysis files |
| `methods/` | Scripts, protocols, parameter files |
| `manuscript/` | Draft manuscripts, supplementary materials |

> **📣 INPUT NEEDED:** Is this folder structure useful, or do researchers prefer flat organization?

---

## 3. Naming Conventions

### 3.1 Publication ID

**Pattern:**
```
PUB-<NNNN>
```

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `PUB` | Fixed prefix | `PUB` |
| `<NNNN>` | Sequential number (4 digits) | `0001`, `0042` |

**Example:** `PUB-0001`

The PUB-ID is used in the registry. The folder uses a **short name** for human readability.

### 3.2 Folder Short Name

**Requirements:**
- Unique across all publication folders
- Human-readable (describes the publication)
- Filesystem-safe: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces
- Ideally stable (chosen before the official title is finalized)

**Pattern suggestion:**
```
<topic>-<distinguisher>-<year>
```

**Examples:**
- `lung-fibrosis-markers-2026`
- `tumor-margin-quantification-2026`
- `pet-mri-fusion-methods-2026`

## 4. Publication Lifecycle

```
┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│   Created     │ ──▶ │  In Progress  │ ──▶ │    Closed     │
│   (PUB-ID)    │     │   (active)    │     │  (published)  │
└───────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────────────┘
       │                     │                      │
  Folder created       Work ongoing            Read-only
  Template files       Provenance logged       DOI recorded
  Registered           Raw data linked         Repository linked
```

### 4.1 Creation

1. **Decide short name** based on expected publication topic
2. **Run creation script** (or manual setup):
   - Creates folder with template structure
   - Creates empty `provenance.csv` with headers
   - Creates `_publication.yaml` template
   - Adds entry to `registry_publications.csv`
3. **Complete metadata** in `_publication.yaml`

### 4.2 In Progress

- **Link raw data:** Add references to source acquisitions in `raw_linked/` (method TBD — see Section 5)
- **Log provenance:** Every derived file added to folder gets a provenance entry
- **Iterate freely:** Internal structure can change; update provenance as needed

### 4.3 Closure

Closure happens when the paper is published (or abandoned). Required steps:

1. **Verify provenance completeness:**
   - Every figure file has a provenance entry
   - All input references resolve to valid raw data or other logged files
2. **Update metadata:**
   - Final title
   - DOI (when available)
   - Repository link (Zenodo, etc.) if data deposited externally
   - Status → `published` or `abandoned`
   - Closed date
3. **Lock folder:** Set read-only permissions
4. **Update registry:** Final status and links

> **🔶 DRAFT:** Closure checklist and automation not yet defined.

## 5. Linking Raw Data

### 5.1 Purpose

The `raw_linked/` folder creates a clear connection between this publication and its source data without duplicating files. The implementation method (symlinks, hard links, or text-based reference list) is still under evaluation.

### 5.2 Options Under Consideration

> **🔶 DRAFT:** Linking method not yet decided. Must consider NAS filesystem type and the operating systems used by researchers (Windows, Linux, etc.).

| Method | Pros | Cons | Filesystem/OS Notes |
|--------|------|------|---------------------|
| **Symlinks** | Clear, navigable; no duplication | Break if paths change; may not survive archival to different storage | Behavior varies across OS; Windows symlinks require specific permissions |
| **Hard links** | Cannot break if source moves within filesystem; no duplication | Same filesystem only; less visible as a "link" | Not all filesystems support them; directories cannot be hard-linked |
| **Reference list (text file)** | Simple, portable, OS-independent | Must look up manually; no filesystem-level navigation | Works everywhere; most robust for archival |
| **Copy files** | Self-contained | Massive duplication | Always works but wastes space |

> **📣 INPUT NEEDED:** The choice depends on the NAS filesystem (ext4? ZFS? NTFS?) and the OS used to access shares (Windows via SMB?). Need to test which linking methods actually work in our environment before deciding.

## 6. Provenance Logging

> Full specification in [07_PROVENANCE](07_PROVENANCE.md).

### 6.1 Summary

Every file added to the publication folder (except boilerplate like `_publication.yaml`) should have a provenance entry documenting:

- What the file is (path, type)
- Where it came from (inputs — raw ACQ-IDs and/or other files)
- How it was created (process description, software, parameters)
- Who created it and when

### 6.2 Minimum at Closure

Before a publication can be closed:

- [ ] All files in `figures/` have provenance entries
- [ ] Provenance chains trace back to raw ACQ-IDs
- [ ] Process descriptions are sufficient to understand transformations

---

## 7. Metadata

### 7.1 Publication Metadata File

**File:** `_publication.yaml`

```yaml
pub_id: PUB-0001
short_name: lung-fibrosis-markers-2026

### 7.2 Registry Fields

See [06_REGISTRIES](06_REGISTRIES.md) for full schema. Key fields:

| Field | Type | Required |
|-------|------|----------|
| `pub_id` | String | Yes |

| `working_title` | String | Yes |
| `status` | Enum | Yes |
| `pi` | String | Yes |
| `first_author` | String | Yes |

## 8. Long-Term Retention

### 8.1 On gjesus3

Publication folders remain on gjesus3 indefinitely (space permitting).

### 8.2 External Repository

> **✅ DECIDED:** Publication data should be deposited to an external repository (e.g., Zenodo) for:
> - Persistent access independent of lab infrastructure
> - DOI for citation
> - Compliance with journal data availability requirements

### 8.3 Offline Archival

If space becomes constrained:
1. Verify external repository contains complete data
2. Update registry with repository link
3. Move to offline storage (external drive, cold cloud)
4. Update `folder_location` in registry
