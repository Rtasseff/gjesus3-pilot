### 2.1.1 Project Linking — Windows-First Design Decision

> **✅ DECIDED — Windows-first, deliberately:** Project links are created as **Windows `.lnk` shell shortcuts** by shelling out to PowerShell's `WScript.Shell` COM object. This is the right choice for the **gjesus3 pilot specifically** and is **not** the recommended default for future RDM deployments. The linker module is structured as the obvious porting seam — see "Porting to other systems" below.

When `ingest_raw.py` is run with `--project <PROJ-ID>` (or `project_hint` set in the YAML config), Step 12 of full-mode ingest creates a shortcut at:

```
/projects/<project_folder>/raw_linked/<original_archive_name>.lnk
```

…targeting the primary archive on the NAS via UNC path (e.g. `\\GJESUS3\gjesus3\raw\DICOM\YYYY\YYYY-MM\ACQ-...\ACQ-....zip`). The shortcut filename preserves the **original** name from staging (e.g. `LEONE_1.01.zip.lnk`), so users browsing a project folder see familiar names; the shortcut's target points at the canonical renamed archive. Shortcuts are idempotent — re-running ingest skips any shortcut that already exists.

#### Why Windows-first for gjesus3

| Constraint | Effect on the choice |
|------------|----------------------|
| **MFB user base is Windows** | Researchers access the NAS via mapped SMB drives in Windows Explorer. Project links must look and behave like ordinary files they can double-click. `.lnk` shortcuts render with the right icon, support double-click, and "Open file location" works. |
| **WSL → SMB symlink path didn't work cleanly** | Creating filesystem-level symbolic links against the QNAP SMB share from WSL ran into problems we couldn't work around in reasonable time. |
| **SSH-into-NAS was blocked** | The robust alternative — creating server-side POSIX symlinks via SSH on the QNAP itself — was attempted but IT could not provide working SSH access to the appliance. We chose to stop pushing on that front and adopt a method that works within the access we already had. |
| **`.lnk` shortcuts work without server cooperation** | Pure client-side artifacts. The NAS doesn't need to understand them; they just sit on the share like any other file. |

#### Tradeoffs we accepted

- **Creation is Windows-only.** The linker shells out to `powershell.exe`. Ingest must run on a Windows machine (or a machine with PowerShell 7+ on Linux, untested here). *Reading* shortcuts works fine from any OS — WSL/Linux can list, inspect, and copy `.lnk` files; only creation is restricted.
- **Links are file-level pointers, not filesystem-level links.** They survive being browsed over SMB but are opaque to scripts that walk the filesystem and don't recognize `.lnk` as a follow-able pointer. The CSV manifest at `registries/ingest_manifest.csv` is the script-friendly equivalent and is always written.

#### Porting to other systems

This pilot is intentionally scoped as a test case for larger MFB-area RDM efforts. Future deployments will not share gjesus3's combination of Windows-only users + locked-down QNAP, and the linker module is the seam designed to be swapped:

| Target environment | Likely method | Implementation note |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Linux/macOS user base, ext4/ZFS NAS | POSIX **symlinks** | Replace the body of `linker.create_lnk()` with `os.symlink(target, lnk_path)`. Drop `.lnk` extension from the filename. |
| Mixed user base, NAS supports SSH | Server-side POSIX symlinks via SSH | `ln -s` runs on the NAS itself; resulting symlinks are visible to every client filesystem-canonically. |
| Constrained / mixed-OS / no link support | Manifest-only | The CSV manifest at `registries/ingest_manifest.csv` is the portable, link-free reference and is already always written. Just don't call `create_lnk`. |
| Cross-platform desperate compromise | Both `.lnk` *and* a symlink | Possible but creates two artifacts per acquisition; usually not worth it. |

The choice should be made consciously at the start of any future deployment — it affects what users can browse, how durable links are across renames, and which OSes can run the ingest pipeline.

### 2.1.2 Microscopy metadata extraction — library choice and deferred work

> **✅ DECIDED (2026-05-06):** Embedded metadata is extracted from `.czi` files via the **`czifile`** Python package. The extractor (`tools/ingest/czi_metadata.py`) parses the embedded XML directly into a curated `discovered.czi_*` subset (referenceable from YAML `registry:` blocks) and a structured `microscopy:` sidecar block. Pylibczirw, AICSImageIO, and Bio-Formats were considered and **deferred**.

#### Why czifile (now)

| Reason | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **No new dependency surface** | czifile is pure Python; already in `requirements.txt`. Bio-Formats requires a JVM; pylibCZIrw requires a native binary; AICSImageIO pulls a heavier transitive set. |
| **Metadata-only access is cheap** | We never read pixel data — JPEG-XR / proprietary compression of pixels is irrelevant to us. czifile happily exposes the metadata XML even for compression formats it can't decode. |
| **Direct XML is auditable** | Our extractor walks the XML tree and the field-source mapping is visible (see `09_MODALITIES.md §1.1` "Auto-discovered fields" table). No hidden normalization layer between the file and what we record. |
| **Cross-instrument reuse** | The same code path works for Cell Observer (`CELL`) and LSM 900 (`LSM9`) since they share `.czi`. |

#### What we get / what we lose

We get every field surfaced in `09_MODALITIES.md §1.1` plus the full structured `microscopy:` block in the sidecar. We do not get an OME-XML mapping, OMERO-ready exports, or pixel access. Those are the deferred items below.

#### Deferred (revisit when there's a concrete need)

| Tool | When it'd matter | What it adds |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| **Bio-Formats CLI (`showinf -nopix -omexml`)** | Ad-hoc metadata inspection; cross-format normalization. | OME-XML output for ~181 standardized CZI fields. Useful as an interactive checking tool on a dev workstation; not in the pipeline. |
| **pylibCZIrw** (ZEISS-native) | When we need pixel access alongside metadata, raw XML editing, or `read_custom_key_value()` exposed natively. | Convenience helpers (`read_general_document_info()`, `read_scaling_info()`, etc.); ZEISS-maintained. |
| **AICSImageIO** | If we move toward analysis-friendly Python access to image data with metadata attached. | Unified API across vendor formats; dims/shape/physical sizes; OME-converted metadata. |
| **OMERO export** | Once researchers want a browsable image server for the ingested data. | Server-side image database; uses Bio-Formats internally. The `microscopy:` sidecar should be most of what's needed to populate OMERO annotations later. |

The extractor is the natural seam to swap libraries: today it's `czi_metadata.extract(czi_path)` calling `czifile`; tomorrow that function can wrap pylibCZIrw or call out to Bio-Formats without touching the rest of the pipeline.

### 2.1.2b Bruker ParaVision metadata extraction (round 6, 2026-05-20)

> **🔶 IN PROGRESS:** Internal MRI ingest uses **JCAMP-DX text aux files** (`subject`, `acqp`, `method`, `visu_pars`, per-recon `visu_pars`/`reco`) as the canonical metadata source — *not* the embedded DICOM headers. ParaVision aux files carry pulse sequence parameters, gating values, reconstruction index, animal subject info that the DICOM headers strip. Pure-DICOM-header extraction (for collaborator XMRI) stays deferred as an independent stream.

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `tools/ingest/jcampdx.py` | Minimal pure-Python JCAMP-DX parser. `parse_file(path) -> dict`. Handles `##KEY=value` scalars, `##KEY=( N )` arrays spanning multiple lines, `<...>` strings, `$$` comments. Used by `paravision_metadata.py`; no third-party dependency. |
| `tools/ingest/paravision_metadata.py` | Mirrors `czi_metadata.py` shape. `load_paravision_exam(exam_path) -> dict`, `build_mri_section() -> dict` (4 curated buckets: `subject`, `acquisition`, `geometry`, `reconstruction` + `_raw_metadata`), `EXPOSED_FIELDS` (~15 curated `discovered.mri_*` fields), `extract(exam_path) -> (discovered_subset, mri_section)`. |
| `tools/ingest/probe_paravision.py` | Standalone read-only probe utility, mirrors `probe_czi.py`. Dumps parsed JCAMP-DX + the curated subset to `_probes/`. |

**Dispatcher.** `FORMAT_EMBEDDED_EXTRACTORS["DICOM"]` runs a content-based detector: if `acqp` + `method` files are present alongside the source, it dispatches to `paravision_metadata.extract`. If not (collaborator XMRI shape — a zip), it returns `({}, {})` (current behaviour preserved). This keeps the MRI → DICOM ecosystem mapping intact while supporting two very different internal data shapes under the same bucket.

#### Why JCAMP-DX text parsing (and not nmrglue / bruker2nifti)

| Reason | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Minimal dependency surface** | A small text parser (~80 LOC) is cheaper than pulling in `nmrglue` or `bruker2nifti`, which carry NMR/MR-image conversion logic we don't need at ingest. |
| **Auditable** | Walking JCAMP-DX is straightforward; the field-source mapping is visible in `paravision_metadata.EXPOSED_FIELDS` (and mirrored in `09_MODALITIES.md` MRI section). |
| **Library deps stay future** | If we later add raw → NIfTI conversion as a project-level tool (see §2.6 below), pulling in `dcm2niix` or `bruker2nifti` happens *there*, not in the ingest pipeline. |

### 2.1.3 Auto-discovery: `filename_parse`, `path_parse`, `regex_extract`

Two parallel mechanisms in the `auto_discover:` block extract metadata from where it already sits in the source layout. Both produce values in the per-case `discovered.<name>` namespace, available everywhere the resolver runs (`registry:`, `auto_create_project:`).

| Feature | What it parses | Where it lives in YAML |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| `filename_parse:` | The filename, split on a separator into named positional chunks | `auto_discover.filename_parse` |
| `path_parse:` | The path components **between `staging_dir` and the file**, top-down, one named level per component | `auto_discover.path_parse` |

Both are **fully free-form on the level/chunk names** — they are labels the operator picks to describe the layout, not a fixed vocabulary. The pipeline never inspects the names; only the `registry:` and `auto_create_project:` references (`discovered.<name>` and `${discovered.<name>}`) consume them. Pick names that read clearly for the instrument and convention you're documenting.

**`filename_parse`** — positional split:

```yaml
auto_discover:
  filename_parse:
    separator: "_"
    fields: [cell_line, experiment, magnification, condition, image_num]
```

For `HLF_alphasma_10x_CC-miR-29a_1.czi` this populates `discovered.cell_line = "HLF"`, `discovered.experiment = "alphasma"`, etc. Mismatched-chunk-count files are skipped with a WARN.

**`path_parse`** — top-down path levels between `staging_dir` and the file:

```yaml
auto_discover:
  staging_dir: "G:/Lab/CellObserver/MBC"
  pattern:     "**/*.czi"          # recursive glob — required when path_parse is in use
  path_parse:
    levels:
      - researcher
      - cell_line
      - experiment
```

For a file at `G:/Lab/CellObserver/MBC/Itziar/HLF/alphasma/HLF_alphasma_10x_CC-miR-29a_1.czi`, the three levels (`Itziar`, `HLF`, `alphasma`) become `discovered.researcher`, `discovered.cell_line`, `discovered.experiment`. Mismatched-depth files (too few or too many levels) are skipped with a WARN — same pattern as `filename_parse`.

Both can be used together; if a value is parsed from both sides (e.g. both filename and path carry `cell_line`), `path_parse` runs first and the filename value **overwrites** it — so `filename_parse` wins on collision. Same-value collisions are silent (redundant but harmless). **Different-value collisions emit a per-key WARN** that names the file, the key, both values, and reminds the operator the filename wins by design — a misfiled-file signal. The cleaner approach when you don't actually want the redundancy is to give parallel chunks distinct names (e.g. `path_cell_line` vs `filename_cell_line`) and let the `registry:` block decide which to record.

**`regex_extract`** — optional named-group extraction for messy names (new 2026-05-20):

When positional `separator + fields` splitting doesn't fit (e.g. FTP server names that mix timestamps + duplicated study IDs + serials), add a `regex:` block to `filename_parse` with a Python regex that uses named groups. Each named group becomes a `discovered.<name>`.

```yaml
auto_discover:
  filename_parse:
    regex: '(?P<jrc_id>jrc_?\d{6,8}_m\d+_\d{4})'
```

For a folder name like `20251016_083822_jrc_251016_m17_0424_jrc_251016_m17_0424_1_1`, the regex pulls `discovered.jrc_id = "jrc_251016_m17_0424"` and ignores the surrounding noise. Use cases: Bruker ParaVision FTP folder names (round 6); any future instrument that produces noisy filenames.

**`separator`/`fields` vs `regex` choice:**

- Use `separator` + `fields` when every chunk of the name is meaningful in a stable positional order — works for AxioScan and Cell Observer.
- Use `regex` when you want to extract a few named values from a name with extra positional noise — works for the MRI FTP folder convention.
- Mixing is allowed: a `regex:` block runs first; any `discovered.<name>` it sets overrides defaults. Then `separator` + `fields` runs on the same input (if both are present) and applies normal collision rules.
- WARN on regex non-match (no name groups extracted) — file is still ingested with whatever other discovery sources populate `discovered`.

### 2.1.4 `auto_create_project:` block

When `ingest.auto_create_projects: true` and a new project is about to be created during an ingest, the optional `auto_create_project:` block supplies the project's metadata. Values resolve through the same mechanism as `registry:` — literal text, `discovered.<field>`, `${...}` interpolation, or `NA`.

```yaml
auto_create_project:
  owner:       "${discovered.researcher}"
  description: "${discovered.experiment} (auto-created from ${discovered.researcher} folder)"
  notes:       ""
```

**Recognized fields:** `owner`, `description`, `notes`. Any field omitted is left empty in `_project.yaml` and `registry_projects.csv`; the project can be edited manually afterward.

**First-write-wins.** The block is read **only** when the project does not already exist. On subsequent ingests that resolve `project_hint` to the same existing project, the block is ignored and an INFO line is logged (`"Project proj-<name> already exists; auto_create_project block ignored."`). This is deliberate — auto-create sets initial defaults, and the source of truth after that is `_project.yaml` (manually editable). No silent updates from later ingests.

**Empty resolved values.** If `${discovered.<x>}` resolves to empty (the discovered field is missing on a given file), the resulting metadata field is empty and the ingest logs a WARN. Project creation proceeds; the field can be filled in by hand later via `_project.yaml`.

**Project naming caveat.** The `short_name` of the auto-created project comes from `registry.project_hint`, not from this block. Any expression in `project_hint` (literal, `discovered.X`, interpolation) is allowed. **Provisional name patterns** like `${researcher}-${experiment}` should be documented as such in the YAML comments — see the Cell Observer example below. [05_PROJECTS §9](05_PROJECTS.md) elaborates on the requirement that the group converge on a durable, meaning-bearing naming convention; auto-create is not a substitute for that conversation.

When `auto_create_projects: false` (the default) or when the project already exists, the `auto_create_project:` block is ignored entirely.

---

**Two Ingest Modes:**

> **✅ DECIDED:** Full mode (default) extracts metadata and compresses DICOM before archiving. Lightweight mode copies as-is for constrained environments.

**Full Mode (default) — per acquisition:**
1. Load + validate config (YAML or interactive)
2. Analyze source data (DICOM headers: modality, StudyDate, file count, size)
3. Extract embedded metadata → `metadata.json` sidecar
4. Compress DICOM (if applicable) → `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive
5. Generate ACQ-ID (read registry for next sequence number)
6. Create folder: `raw/<ECOSYSTEM>/<YYYY>/<YYYY-MM>/<ACQ-ID>/`
7. Copy files to destination (archive + metadata.json + README.txt, with progress bar)
8. Generate `checksums.json` (SHA-256, all files in acquisition folder)
9. Verify copy — recompute checksums on destination, compare
10. Generate `README.txt`
11. Append row to `registry_raw.csv` (all fields populated, including `original_name`)
12. Append entry to `registries/ingest_manifest.csv` (always); if `--project` is set, also create a Windows `.lnk` shortcut in `<project>/raw_linked/` pointing at the canonical archive (see §2.1.1)
13. Report summary

**Lightweight Mode (`--lightweight`) — per acquisition:**
1. Load + validate config (fewer required fields)
2. Generate ACQ-ID
3. Create folder: `raw/<ECOSYSTEM>/<YYYY>/<YYYY-MM>/<ACQ-ID>/`
4. Copy archive as-is to destination (user provides pre-compressed archive or files)
5. Generate `checksums.json`
6. Generate `README.txt`
7. Append row to `registry_raw.csv` (auto fields only; `extended_metadata_present` = `N`)
8. Report summary

**Configuration schema (since 2026-05-06):**

Three required top-level blocks plus one optional. `defaults:` is gone — non-registry control flags moved to `ingest:`, and the per-column registry mapping is explicit in `registry:`.

| Block                   | Required? | Purpose |
|-------------------------|-----------|---------|
| `ingest:`               | Yes       | Pipeline control flags (`delete_source_after_ingest`, `auto_create_projects`, ...). Not registry columns. |
| `auto_discover:`        | Yes       | How to discover cases and what variables to extract per case. Each case's discovered fields land in a `discovered` namespace, referenceable below. Supports `filename_parse:` and `path_parse:` (see §2.1.3). |
| `registry:`             | Yes       | Explicit per-column registry mapping. Three value forms: literal text/number, `discovered.<field>` (bare reference), or `"...${discovered.<field>}..."` (interpolation). Use `NA` to leave a column intentionally empty. |
| `auto_create_project:`  | Optional  | Project-creation metadata used only when `ingest.auto_create_projects: true` and a new project is being created. Resolver-evaluated like `registry:`. First-write-wins (see §2.1.4). |

`ingest:` flags currently honored:

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `delete_source_after_ingest` | `false` | Remove the source file/folder after a successful copy + verify. CLI `--delete-source` overrides. |
| `auto_create_projects` | `false` | When `registry.project_hint` resolves to a value that isn't an existing `project_id` or `short_name`, auto-create a project with that value as the `short_name`. First ingest creates; subsequent ingests with the same hint reuse via `short_name` lookup. Useful when the project key comes from a parsed filename chunk (e.g. `project_hint: discovered.project`). Default `false` to prevent typos from silently creating rogue projects. When enabled, the optional `auto_create_project:` block (§2.1.4) supplies the new project's `owner` / `description` / `notes`. |
| `acquisition_layout` | `file` | New 2026-05-20. One of `file` (single primary file: microscopy `.czi`), `archive` (compressed archive: legacy collaborator DICOM `.zip`), or `folder` (folder-as-primary: internal MRI ParaVision bundle — no zip). Drives the file-copy step and the `primary_kind` registry column. Per-instrument templates set this; per-batch configs rarely override. See [03_RAW_STORAGE §4.2](03_RAW_STORAGE.md). |
| `reconstructions` | (none) | New 2026-05-20 (MRI-specific). Selects which reconstruction indices to retain from a ParaVision exam. Values: `all` \| an integer (e.g. `3`) \| a list of integers (e.g. `[3]` or `[1, 3]`). The platform convention is `/3` user-trusted, but the user explicitly decides per-batch; there is no implicit default. Indices not listed stay only on the platform's deep-archive. The registry's `discovered.mri_recon_indices` column records what was kept. |

The user-controllable `registry:` columns are: `instrument`, `data_ecosystem`, `instrument_model`, `modalities_in_study`, `operator`, `data_source`, `sample_id`, `sample_type`, `session_id` (DRAFT — see [06_REGISTRIES §2.2 + §2.3a](06_REGISTRIES.md)), `acquisition_datetime`, `project_hint`, `notes`. Of these, **`instrument`, `data_ecosystem`, `operator`, `data_source` must be present** (NA allowed where intentional); the rest are optional. Auto-populated columns (`acq_id`, `registration_datetime`, `primary_kind` (DRAFT), `primary_file_name`, `file_format`, `file_size_mb`, `file_count`, `canonical_path`, `checksum_present`, `extended_metadata_present`, `original_name`, `ingest_config`) must NOT appear in `registry:`.

**Templates layout** — start from the per-instrument template under [`tools/templates/instruments/`](../tools/templates/instruments/) (currently: `axioscan7.yaml`); the universal starter [`tools/templates/ingest_template.yaml`](../tools/templates/ingest_template.yaml) is the fallback for instruments not yet onboarded. Edited copies are saved under [`tools/configs/`](../tools/configs/) (under git, version-locked with the script — the relative path is stamped into each registry row's `ingest_config` column). See [`tools/INGEST_CLI.md`](../tools/INGEST_CLI.md) for the full templates/configs layout table.

**Batch configuration — file-mode with filename parsing (AxioScan and similar):**

# ⚠️ PROVISIONAL PROJECT NAMING — the ${researcher}-${experiment} pattern is a stopgap.
# Experiments are metadata, not projects. A real project name should map to a unit of
# funded/owned work (funded project name, animal-project approval ID, or an explicit
# internal name the group agrees on). See 05_PROJECTS §9 for the warning + open
# question; the group must converge on a real naming convention.

**Single-case configuration:**

```yaml
source_path: /data/local_staging/user_dump/
ingest:
  delete_source_after_ingest: false
registry:
  instrument:           ZWSI
  data_ecosystem:       MICROSCOPY
  operator:             MBC
  data_source:          internal

  acquisition_datetime: "2026-02-15"
  notes:                "First test of ingest workflow"
```

**Usage:**

> The script needs a valid NAS root. Set `GJESUS3_ROOT` once per shell (PowerShell: `$env:GJESUS3_ROOT = "J:\"`; bash/WSL: `export GJESUS3_ROOT=/mnt/gjesus3`) or pass `--nas-root <path>` on every command. The script fails fast if the configured path doesn't exist or doesn't contain a `registries/` subfolder. End-user-facing walkthrough: [`11_OPERATIONS.md §3.2`](11_OPERATIONS.md); flag reference: [`tools/INGEST_CLI.md`](../tools/INGEST_CLI.md).

```bash
python tools/ingest_raw.py --config batch_hpic.yaml --dry-run    # preview (full mode)
python tools/ingest_raw.py --config batch_hpic.yaml               # execute (full mode)
python tools/ingest_raw.py --interactive                           # single case (full mode)
python tools/ingest_raw.py --config quick.yaml --lightweight       # lightweight mode
python tools/ingest_raw.py --config batch.yaml --delete-source     # remove source after verify (default OFF)
python tools/ingest_raw.py --interactive --lightweight             # lightweight interactive
```

**Key features:**
- Three required top-level blocks plus one optional: `ingest:` (control), `auto_discover:` (extract `discovered.*` via `filename_parse` and/or `path_parse` — see §2.1.3), `registry:` (explicit per-column mapping with literal | `discovered.X` | `${...}` interp | NA), and optional `auto_create_project:` (owner/description/notes for first-time project auto-creation — see §2.1.4). Universal starter at `tools/templates/ingest_template.yaml`; per-instrument templates under `tools/templates/instruments/`.
- Auto-populated columns (`acq_id`, `registration_datetime`, `primary_file_name`, `file_format`, `file_size_mb`, `file_count`, `canonical_path`, `checksum_present`, `extended_metadata_present`, `original_name`, `ingest_config`) — script-controlled, not user-editable.
- `ingest_config` registry column records the relative path of the YAML config that produced the row, for auditability + reproducibility.
- Two ingest modes: full (default) and lightweight (`--lightweight`, planned)
- DICOM header auto-detection (modality, StudyDate via pydicom) — full mode
- DICOM archive creation (compress to .zip or .tar.gz) — full mode (planned)
- Microscopy single-file ingest (`.czi` etc.) with rename to canonical `{acq_id}{ext}`
- `metadata.json` sidecar (cross-format; `user_supplied` + `discovered`; ecosystem-specific section reserved for embedded-metadata extraction)
- Filename parser (positional) for instruments that encode metadata in filenames
- Collaborator instrument codes: X-prefix (e.g., `XMRI` for external MRI)
- Copy verification: SHA-256 source→dest comparison
- **Idempotent re-runs**: `expand_batch` checks the registry by `(acquisition_date, original_name)` and skips already-ingested files
- `--delete-source` flag removes the source file/folder after a successful verify (cross-instrument; default OFF; never touches the parent of `source_path`)
- Project link creation: `.lnk` shortcut placed in `<project>/raw_linked/` when `--project` is set (Windows-only — see §2.1.1)
- `--dry-run` mode for previewing without changes
- Batch auto-discovery for processing many cases at once (file or directory globs)

### 2.2 `create_publication` — Publication Package Setup

**Purpose:** Create a new publication folder with required structure and registry entry.

**Inputs:**
- Short name (folder name)
- Working title
- PI, first author
- Optional: description, linked raw data

**Actions:**
1. Validate short name is unique
2. Generate PUB-ID
3. Create folder structure:
   - `_publication.yaml` (from template)
   - `provenance.csv` (empty with headers)
   - `raw_linked/` folder
   - Optional: `figures/`, `analysis/`, `methods/`
4. Append entry to registry_publications.csv
5. Report success with folder path

**Usage:**
```bash
create_publication \
  --name "lung-fibrosis-markers-2026" \
  --title "Quantification of fibrotic markers in IPF lung tissue" \
  --pi "Jesús Ruiz-Cabello" \
  --first-author "Marta Beraza"
```

### 2.3 `log_activity` — Provenance Helper

**Purpose:** Simplify adding entries to the provenance log.

**Inputs:**
- Output file path
- Input references (ACQ-IDs, FILE-IDs, or paths)
- Process description
- Creator
- Optional: software version, parameter file, notebook reference

**Actions:**
1. Determine which provenance.csv to update (from output path)
2. Generate next FILE-ID
3. Validate input references exist
4. Append entry to provenance.csv
5. Confirm entry

**Usage:**
```bash
log_activity \
  --output figures/fig1_panel_a.tiff \
  --inputs "ACQ-20260115-ZWSI-001" \
  --process "ROI extraction and contrast adjustment" \
  --creator MBC \
  --software "ImageJ 1.54f"
```

## 3. Utility Scripts

### 3.1 `create_project` — Project Workspace Setup

**Purpose:** Create a new project folder with required structure and registry entry.

**Location:** `tools/create_project.py`

**Inputs:**
- Short name (folder name)
- Description
- Owner (initials)

**Actions:**
1. Validate short name is unique (scan `registry_projects.csv`)
2. Generate PROJ-ID (`PROJ-NNNN`, next available)
3. Create folder: `/projects/proj-<short_name>/`
4. Write `_project.yaml` from template
5. Create empty `provenance.csv` with headers
6. Create `raw_linked/` directory
7. Append entry to `registries/registry_projects.csv`
8. Print summary

**Usage:**
```bash
python tools/create_project.py \
  --name "ipf-biomarkers" \
  --description "IPF biomarker quantification study" \
  --owner MBC

python tools/create_project.py --interactive
python tools/create_project.py --name test --description "test" --owner RT --dry-run
```

### 3.2 `validate_registries`

**Purpose:** Check registry integrity.

**Checks:**
- All paths resolve to existing folders
- Required fields are populated
- IDs are unique
- Dates are valid format
- Cross-references are valid

### 3.3 `verify_checksums`

**Purpose:** Verify file integrity against stored checksums.

**Usage:**
```bash
verify_checksums --scope /raw/MICROSCOPY/2026/  # Check specific path
verify_checksums --sample 10  # Random 10% sample
```

### 3.4 Metadata Extraction and Backfill

> **✅ DECIDED:** Auto-extraction of embedded metadata is integrated into full-mode ingest — not a separate standalone tool. The DICOM archive format decision is resolved (compressed archives); extraction happens before compression during full-mode ingest.

**Metadata extraction (integrated into `ingest_raw` full mode):**
- Reads embedded metadata from raw files (DICOM headers via pydicom, .czi metadata, etc.)
- Writes `metadata.json` sidecar in the acquisition folder
- Sets `extended_metadata_present` = `Y` in registry

**`backfill_metadata` — upgrade lightweight ingests:**

**Purpose:** Retroactively extract metadata from acquisitions that were ingested in lightweight mode. Decompresses the archive to a temp directory, extracts metadata, writes `metadata.json`, updates registry.

**Usage:**
```bash
python tools/backfill_metadata.py --acq-id ACQ-20260301-XMRI-001   # single
python tools/backfill_metadata.py --scope /raw/DICOM/2026/          # batch
python tools/backfill_metadata.py --dry-run --scope /raw/DICOM/     # preview
```

**Supported formats:** DICOM (.dcm via pydicom), .czi (via aicspylibczi or czifile), others TBD

> **Note:** User-supplied metadata (sample context, experimental notes via CSVs/Excel) remains deferred.

## 4. Implementation Decisions

### 4.1 Language

> **🔶 RECOMMENDATION:** Python 3.10+

Rationale:
- Good library support for file handling, CSV, JSON
- Libraries for format-specific metadata extraction
- Familiar to scientific computing community

### 4.2 Where Scripts Run

> **⚠️ GAP:** Need to decide execution environment.

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Designated workstation** | Controlled environment; consistent | Requires access to that machine |
| **User machines** | Convenient; work where you are | Dependency management; consistency |
| **NAS (QNAP apps)** | Runs where data is | Limited environment; complexity |

**Tentative:** Designated workstation with network access to NAS

### 4.3 Distribution and Versioning

> **⚠️ GAP:** Need to establish script management.

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Git repository | Version controlled; users pull updates |
| Shared folder | Scripts on network drive; single source |
| Package | pip-installable package (more overhead) |

**Tentative:** Git repository with periodic releases copied to shared folder

## 5. User Interface Options

### 5.1 Command Line (Primary)

All tools available as CLI scripts. Suitable for power users and scripting.

### 5.2 Simple GUI Wrappers (Future)

For less technical users, consider:
- Tkinter-based simple dialogs
- Web interface (Flask/FastAPI)
- Jupyter notebooks with widgets

> **📋 Future consideration:** GUI wrappers based on user feedback during pilot.

---

## 6. Dependencies

**Python packages likely needed:**
- `pyyaml` — Configuration files
- `python-dateutil` — Date parsing
- `tqdm` — Progress bars
- `hashlib` (stdlib) — Checksums
- `pydicom` — DICOM metadata
- `tifffile` — TIFF metadata
- `czifile` or `aicspylibczi` — Zeiss CZI metadata

---

## 7. Development Roadmap

| Phase | Tools | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Pilot** | `ingest_raw` (full + lightweight modes), `create_publication`, `create_project` | Before pilot start |
| **Pilot** | Metadata extractors (integrated into full-mode ingest) | Before first batch ingest |
| **Pilot+** | `backfill_metadata` (upgrade lightweight ingests) | During pilot |
| **Pilot+** | `log_activity`, `validate_registries` | During pilot |
| **Post-pilot** | GUI wrappers, user-supplied metadata workflows | Based on demand |
