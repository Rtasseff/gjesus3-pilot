# 06 — Registries

**Parent:** [Documentation Index](00_INDEX.md)
**Status:** 🔶 Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-20 (DRAFT `session_id` + `primary_kind` columns for ISA grouping + per-ecosystem layout shapes; ISA terminology mapping added in §2.3a)

---

## Purpose

This document specifies the top-level registries that index and document the contents of the storage areas.

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What Are Registries?

Registries are **CSV files** that serve as indexes (manifests) for each storage area. When data is added to the system, an entry is "registered" by adding a row to the appropriate registry.

### 1.2 Registry Locations

> **✅ DECIDED:** All registries live in a single top-level `registries/` directory — centralized, not distributed within each storage area.

| Registry | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Raw Registry | `/gjesus3/registries/registry_raw.csv` | Indexes all raw acquisitions |
| Publications Registry | `/gjesus3/registries/registry_publications.csv` | Indexes all publication folders |
| Projects Registry | `/gjesus3/registries/registry_projects.csv` | Indexes all project folders |
| Curated Datasets Registry | `/gjesus3/registries/registry_datasets.csv` | Indexes all curated datasets (if used) |

### 1.3 Why CSV?

| Consideration | CSV Advantage |
|---------------|---------------|
| Human-readable | Can open in any text editor or spreadsheet |
| Tool-friendly | Easy to parse, query, update with scripts |
| Version control | Works well with git if we version registries |
| No dependencies | No database setup or special software |
| Recovery | Even if corrupted, partial data is recoverable |

**Limitation:** Concurrent writes need care (but our low-volume use case makes this manageable).

## 2. Raw Registry

**File:** `/gjesus3/registries/registry_raw.csv`

### 2.1 Purpose

Authoritative record of all raw acquisitions deposited in the system.

### 2.2 Schema

> **✅ DECIDED:** Fields are classified by **Population** method — how they get filled during ingest. This enables lightweight mode to produce sparse-but-valid registry entries.

| Field | Type | Required | Population | Description |
|-------|------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `acq_id` | String | ✅ Yes | Auto | Unique acquisition ID (e.g., `ACQ-20260215-ZWSI-001`) |
| `registration_datetime` | ISO DateTime | ✅ Yes | Auto | When this entry was added |
| `acquisition_datetime` | ISO DateTime | 🔶 Recommended | User | When the data was actually acquired. User-supplied via the YAML `registry:` block — either a literal, a `discovered.<field>` reference (e.g. `discovered.acquisition_date` for AxioScan day folders), or `NA` to backfill later. Future: auto-extract from DICOM/.czi headers via the `discovered` namespace. |
| `data_ecosystem` | String | ✅ Yes | User | `MICROSCOPY`, `DICOM`, or `EM`. Determines the top-level folder. |
| `instrument` | String | ✅ Yes | User | Instrument code (e.g., `ZWSI`, `LSM9`, `PET`). |
| `instrument_model` | String | 🔶 Recommended | User | Full instrument name (e.g., `Bruker BioSpec 11.7T`). |
| `modalities_in_study` | String | Optional | User (or auto fallback) | For multi-modal acquisitions: semicolon-separated DICOM modality codes (e.g., `PT;CT`). If left empty/NA, falls back to the source summarizer's `modality` field. |
| `operator` | String | ✅ Yes | User | Person who collected the data. |
| `data_source` | String | ✅ Yes | User | `internal` or `collaborator:<name>`. |
| `sample_id` | String | 🔶 Recommended | User | Sample or animal identifier. See §2.3 for the recommended composite format. |
| `sample_type` | String | 🔶 Recommended | User | Category of biological material. Use the controlled vocabulary in §2.4 (DRAFT). |
| `session_id` | String | 🔶 Recommended (DRAFT) | User | DRAFT 2026-05-20. Groups acquisitions that share a session (one animal session, one MR study, one microscopy slide-loading round, etc.). Maps to the ISA "study" level — see §2.3a. For MRI, value is typically the JRC study identifier (`jrc251016_m17_0424`). For microscopy where acquisitions don't share a meaningful session, may be empty / NA. Status open (REG-08) pending PI sign-off. |
| `primary_kind` | String | ✅ Yes (DRAFT) | Auto | DRAFT 2026-05-20. One of `file` \| `archive` \| `folder` — the shape of the primary entity on disk. `file` = single canonical file (microscopy `.czi`). `archive` = compressed archive (legacy collaborator DICOM `.zip`). `folder` = the acquisition folder itself is the unit (internal MRI ParaVision bundle). See [03_RAW_STORAGE §4.2](03_RAW_STORAGE.md). |
| `primary_file_name` | String | ✅ Yes | Auto | Canonical name of the primary entity. When `primary_kind` = `file` or `archive`, this is a filename (`<ACQ-ID>.czi`, `<ACQ-ID>.zip`). When `primary_kind` = `folder`, this is the folder name (`<ACQ-ID>`) — the unit IS the folder, see [03_RAW_STORAGE §4.3](03_RAW_STORAGE.md). |
| `original_name` | String | ✅ Yes | Auto | Source filename / folder name before ingestion. |
| `file_format` | String | ✅ Yes | Auto | File extension/format (e.g., `.czi`, `.zip`). |
| `file_size_mb` | Number | ✅ Yes | Auto | Size of primary file/folder in **decimal MB** (bytes ÷ 1,000,000), rounded to 1 decimal. Convention adopted 2026-05-12; pre-cutover rows hold the binary value (bytes ÷ 1,048,576) and are not being backfilled. Windows Explorer uses its own hybrid (bytes ÷ 1024 ÷ 1000) and will not match either form exactly. |
| `file_count` | Number | ✅ Yes | Auto | Number of **primary-data files** in the acquisition — not auxiliary or bookkeeping artifacts (`metadata.json`, `checksums.json`, `README.txt`). DICOM: count of `.dcm` (or extensionless DICOM) files. Microscopy: `1` for single-file (`.czi`) acquisitions; for folder-mode batches, count of primary-format files (`.czi`/`.tif`/`.tiff`). Convention adopted 2026-05-12; pre-cutover DICOM rows hold an uninformative count (4 = destination-folder file count) and are not being backfilled. Once DICOM compress-on-ingest ships, the count should come from the archive's central directory rather than the source walk. |
| `canonical_path` | String | ✅ Yes | Auto | Full path to acquisition folder. |
| `checksum_present` | String (Y/N) | ✅ Yes | Auto | `Y` or `N` — is checksums.json present? |
| `extended_metadata_present` | String (Y/N) | ✅ Yes | Auto | `Y` (full mode) or `N` (lightweight mode). |
| `project_hint` | String | Optional | User | Associated project ID if known at deposit. Triggers `.lnk` creation when set. |
| `ingest_config` | String | 🔶 Recommended | Auto | Path (relative to repo root) of the YAML config that produced this row. Empty for interactive ingests or pre-2026-05-06 rows. Used for auditability and reproducibility. |
| `notes` | String | Optional | User | Free-text notes. Supports `${discovered.<field>}` interpolation. |

**Population key:**
- **Auto** — set by the ingest pipeline; user must NOT put it in the YAML `registry:` block.
- **User** — set in the YAML `registry:` block (literal, `discovered.<field>`, or `NA`). See [10_TOOLS §2.1](10_TOOLS.md).

### 2.3a ISA Terminology Mapping (DRAFT)

> **🔶 DRAFT pilot guidance (2026-05-20).** The MFB workflow maps cleanly onto **ISA** (Investigation / Study / Assay) terminology. Adopting that vocabulary in the registry makes the data more compatible with REMBI-style metadata standards and any future migration to XNAT / OMERO / institutional platforms. Status open (REG-09) pending PI sign-off.

| ISA term | gjesus3 equivalent | Where recorded | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Investigation** | Project | `registry_projects.csv` → `project_id` + `short_name` | `PROJ-0007` / `itziar-alphasma` (or for MRI, an animal-protocol-coded project like `PROJ-NNNN` with short_name `ae-biomegune-0525`) |
| **Study** | Session — a coherent acquisition session (one animal session, one slide-loading round) | `registry_raw.csv` → new `session_id` column (DRAFT, see §2.2) | `jrc251016_m17_0424` for an internal MRI session |
| **Assay** | Acquisition — one scan with a distinct protocol | `registry_raw.csv` → `acq_id` (one row) | `ACQ-20251016-MRI-029` |

**Why this matters:**

- For MRI: one ParaVision study folder contains many numbered exams (assays). Each exam is its own ACQ-ID; they share a `session_id` (the JRC study identifier) so the session can be reconstructed via simple registry query.
- For collaborator DICOM (rounds 1-2): the existing zip-per-session model maps onto session=assay (one row, no separate `session_id` populated). Legacy; not retrofitting.
- For microscopy: typically session and assay collapse (one `.czi` = one slide = one session = one assay). `session_id` may be empty/NA; sample_id carries the grouping.

**Implementation:** `session_id` is User-populated via the YAML `registry:` block (literal, `discovered.<field>`, or NA). Existing rows are not backfilled; pre-cutover acquisitions hold empty `session_id`.

### 2.3 Sample ID Format (DRAFT)

> **🔶 DRAFT pilot guidance.** Recommended `sample_id` format is `<short_project>_<short_sample>`. Status remains open (REG-01) pending PI sign-off after pilot validation.

The `sample_id` chunk recorded by an instrument (e.g. `ID26H` on an AxioScan filename) is typically **not unique on its own** — the same short ID gets reused across projects. The combination `<short_project>_<short_sample>` (e.g. `0525_ID26H`) is what makes a row globally identifiable within `registry_raw.csv`.

**Recommended pattern** (apply via YAML interpolation; no code change needed):

```yaml
registry:
  sample_id: "${discovered.project}_${discovered.sample_short}"
```

This composes the registry value at ingest time from filename chunks. The raw chunks remain in the per-acquisition `metadata.json` `discovered` block (alongside any auto-extracted embedded fields), so the decomposition is never lost.

**Notes:**

- If a `<short_project>` is genuinely unset (no project chunk in the filename), leave `sample_id` as the bare short ID and accept that uniqueness is project-scoped only. Flag in `notes`.
- This convention does **not** override official sample identifiers when they exist as a single string already (e.g. an animal registry ID like `MOUSE-2024-042`). Use those verbatim in `sample_id` and skip the composite.
- Organ-letter encoding inside the short ID (e.g. `H` = Heart, `B` = Brain in `ID26H`) is not parsed today; team convention is not yet confirmed. Tracked as a future enhancement.

### 2.4 Sample Type Vocabulary (DRAFT)

> **🔶 DRAFT pilot guidance.** `sample_type` is the category of biological material in REMBI terms — *not* the species and *not* the anatomy. Status open (REG-07) pending PI sign-off.

REMBI separates concerns: **sample type** (the kind of biological material), **organism/species**, **anatomical entity**, **preparation**, and **imaging mode**. In the current registry only one of these has its own column (`sample_type`); the others ride along in `sample_id` / `notes` for now (see future split tracked in `tasks/tasks.md` §3.1).

**Controlled vocabulary** — small enough to remember, broad enough to cover everything in scope:

| Value | Means | Examples in this project |
|-------|-------|--------------------------|
| `tissue` | Excised biological material (sections, slices, biopsies, fixed/unfixed) | All AxioScan / Cell Observer / LSM 900 WSI of mouse organ sections |
| `organism` | Whole live or post-mortem animal | In vivo MRI, PET/CT, SPECT of mice |
| `cells` | Cultured or isolated cell preparations | Future Cell Observer cell-culture work (if it lands in scope) |
| `material` | Non-biological samples (nanoparticles, contrast agents, synthetic constructs) | Future SEM/TEM nanomaterial characterization |
| `phantom` | Imaging calibration objects | Platform commissioning / QA scans, if archived |

**Notes:**

- Use lowercase, one of the five values verbatim. If a future sample doesn't fit, flag for vocab extension before ingest rather than inventing a value on the fly.
- Species/anatomy details that today appear as freeform `"mouse lung section"`-style strings in pre-cutover example rows should migrate to dedicated columns once REG-07 closes (proposed `sample_organism` + `anatomical_entity`; tracked in `tasks/tasks.md` §3.1).
- For batches where every acquisition shares the same type, set the value at the YAML template level rather than per-row. The AxioScan 7 per-instrument template pre-fills `sample_type: tissue` for this reason.

> **🔶 Linked requirements (DRAFT 2026-05-29):** For `sample_type ∈ {organism, tissue}`, the per-acquisition `metadata.json` MUST include two blocks:
>
> **`subject:` block** — species / strain / sex / age_at_acquisition (the four ARRIVE-aligned required fields, DECIDED) + optional genotype / weight / facility_animal_id / cohort_id. Schema in [08_METADATA §4.4](08_METADATA.md). Auto-population via animal-facility-DB integration queued in `tasks/tasks.md §3.2`.
>
> **`condition:` block** — `is_control` (**DECIDED-required strict boolean** — the enforceable healthy-vs-case flag) + DRAFT-required `disease_model` + `disease_state` free-text + optional `control_type` / `treatment` / `timepoint_days` / `study_arm`. Schema in [08_METADATA §4.5](08_METADATA.md). Operator-entered only (no auto-source — disease state is a property of study design, not the animal). The `is_control` boolean is the primary cohort-builder filter for "all healthy controls" / "all cases" queries.
>
> Both blocks always required for internal MRI + Nuclear Imaging (sample is always an organism); required for microscopy when the sample is animal-derived (typical case).

### 2.5 Example

> **Note:** The CSV example below shows the schema **including** the DRAFT `session_id` and `primary_kind` columns. Production registry rows pre-2026-05-20 do not have these columns; the schema grows column-by-column with a defensive header check (see [10_TOOLS](10_TOOLS.md)) preventing silent shift.

| Projects | All operators | Operator for own entries; Admin for all |
| Curated Datasets | All operators | Dataset curator or Admin only |

### 6.2 Backup

Registries are critical metadata. Consider:
- Git versioning (if repository set up)
- Periodic backup copies
- Include in any system backup

### 6.3 Validation

> **📋 Planned:** Scripts to validate registry integrity:
> - All paths resolve to actual folders
> - Required fields are populated
> - IDs are unique
> - Dates are valid format
> - `data_ecosystem` values match actual folder locations

Pattern: `ACQ-<YYYYMMDD>-<INST>-<SEQ>`

Generation: Scripted (preferred) or manual with lookup of current day's highest sequence.

### 7.2 Publication IDs

Pattern: `PUB-<NNNN>`

Generation: Next available number (scan registry for highest, increment).

### 7.3 Project IDs

Pattern: `PROJ-<NNNN>`

Generation: Next available number.

### 7.4 Dataset IDs

Pattern: `DS-<TYPE>-<NNNN>`

Generation: Next available number within each type.
